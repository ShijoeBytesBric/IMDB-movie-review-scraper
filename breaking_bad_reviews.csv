Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FiRE010,10,4 July 2021,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),KinoKoopaKid,10,30 July 2021,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bruhperson,10,7 March 2019,Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jehuschultz,10,19 February 2020,I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Supermanfan-13,10,9 November 2021,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rob1331,10,9 December 2022,Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dhanushreddy-14919,10,18 July 2021,Direction- PERFECT!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),manishsingh-03299,10,31 May 2019,When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tushv-31482,10,9 December 2022,"I have never watched any series which depicts emotions so exactly through camera angles, dialogues, screen play, perfect story line other than ""Breaking Bad"". We all are lucky enough to be born to watch series like this. Teaches us loyalty, family love, pain and many more things."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xpinerhd,10,16 November 2019,I wanna delete my brain and watch it again like I never knew it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JaxTL,,6 August 2022,"I usually don't comment on here but this show is the best I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),reebokroot,7,15 February 2021,"If i say that it was good , but not excellent , every fan will try to kill me , but it's my opinion"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nickname-76797,3,23 March 2021,The story is interesting and well developed but the pace is too slow. There are too many unnecessary scenes and filler episodes.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheLittleSongbird,10,13 November 2017,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FishDrowned,10,9 November 2021,"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joegalgano,10,12 August 2021,Nothing compares. Nothing comes close.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gogoschka-1,10,12 January 2014,"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EVON1TY,10,3 March 2023,"This serie is unique. This is somehow realistic and amazing also. Even if you're going to watch for find the flaws, I bet you can't find real major flaws in this serie. You know some people are just tries to find nonsense things in contents. (I mean in a movie or TV show) They are hard to pleased but even those people can enjoy this serie, because they really can't find one easily."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),agatt-87232,10,20 May 2019,I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dristysultana,10,24 June 2021,I liked this series so much that im repeating this show again.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Leofwine_draca,10,5 May 2021,"I'd put off watching BREAKING BAD for years and years, not being particularly interested in a contemporary story about a couple of drug dealers, but I needn't have worried. This is a series that lives up to all the accolades, just as involving and gripping as I'd hoped. About half a dozen actors give career best performances as characters that evolve slowly and realistically over five seasons, and the depth is incredible, along with the refusal to paint a single person in black and white. Humour, suspense, action and the depths of the human existence being frequently explored; there's really nothing better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mreuvers,,29 January 2015,In my opinion this series started out brilliantly on a very interesting premise. But later I think the series started to lose its own credibility. It suffered from the same fate a lot of series have these days: they throw in everything they got at the start to actually make an impression. But that leaves them with only so much for the remaining seasons.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Shopaholic35,7,12 February 2014,"This is a hard show to review. The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking ""really, there are 5 seasons of this"". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mundoaudiofilo,5,1 July 2015,"I really couldn't wait for this to end, I felt it just dragged on & on forever, I felt I had been watching it for 20 years by the time it finally finished."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nasirkazeem,10,8 December 2022,"Spoiler free review of this and i am utterly shocked by how good this show was. Season 1 started off slow so dont drop the show so quickly, this show becomes one of the greatest shows of all time and my favourite show."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),winnantonio,10,10 October 2017,"One of the great movies of its time. Before, and even now is admire as one of the most classic and greatest films of all time. And I agree. I remember when I first watched it I never thought that Sonny would be the one killed, and Michael being the one taking over the family, and ruling with an iron fist. I have to watch at least one or two times a year."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Godz365,10,27 February 2019,The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SEO-Serves2024,8,15 January 2024,"I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ironhorse_iv,10,8 September 2015,"It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),danielgibbs-69210,9,21 July 2016,"There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JamesHitchcock,8,16 May 2004,"Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Coxer99,10,10 June 1999,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bob the moo,,1 July 2002,"Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Clumsy14,7,13 June 2022,"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thomashaehre,5,15 February 2022,"I'm sure it was good for its time, but by todays standard this is truly mediocre. It's 3 hours of boredom, cheesy stereotypical dialog, and unrealistic mafia. Some of the sub plots, like the 30 minute Sicilia sequence, with Michael marrying this girl we have never seen before, only for the movie to kill her off 20 minutes later, before we've even heard her talk? One of the most useless sub plots I have ever seen in any movie. Did they expect us to care for her after introducing her 20 minutes ago, and not even giving her a proper line to say? Movie should have well under 2 hours and at the end of the day was a borefest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tolispro,10,30 March 2019,"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),braco,10,2 August 1998,"This movie alongside Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Godfather:part II, The Third Man and Lawrence Of Arabia is my absolutely favorite film. Some scenes you just can't forget. Vito's character is one of the best played roles in movies history (done by Marlon Brando). This story about Corleone family (together with part 2 and 3) is the greatest movie epic ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Neve_Fan,9,11 August 1998,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bkoganbing,10,9 March 2008,My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cardsrock,10,9 March 2019,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),crendine,10,24 March 2015,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JosephD3193,10,11 May 2018,Really what more about The Godfather can I say that hasen't already been said?
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grantss,10,20 December 2015,"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Stormchaser99,,14 October 2013,I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),briancham1994,7,24 November 2020,"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stand_out2,3,18 April 2008,"The day before yesterday I decided that I should watch The Godfather since it's pretty much a movie that one would have to see during his lifetime, but I was very disappointed. I thought that it would be a great movie with a plot that would be interesting, characters that I could relate to and give me some form of entertainment during the course of the movie, but boy was I wrong."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BrandtSponseller,10,24 April 2005,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Nazi_Fighter_David,10,24 February 2001,"""The Godfather"" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema..."

Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),auuwws,10,15 September 2020,"The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nickenchuggets,10,29 July 2021,"Despite having essentially no italian heritage, Marlon Brando will forever be remembered by millions all over the world as Don Corleone, the mafia boss and main character from one of the greatest movies ever made, period. When it was released in the early 70s, this film was for a time the highest grossing movie ever made and easily eclipsed the money accumulated by other movies produced that same year. Before the sequel (and the less impressive third movie), there was the original mob boss played by Brando who was just the right amount of threatening and respectable. After all these years, this movie still inspires many people around the world to become filmmakers for a number of reasons. It is very long and technically impressive to look at, employs a large number of actors and extras, has great dialogue and acting, and most importantly, has a story that never fails to entertain no matter how much time passes. As you might gather from the title, The Godfather is about the patriarch of an immensely powerful family of underworld criminals, but he is getting old, and maybe it's time for a new leader to be selected. The story begins in 1940s New York, where Vito Corleone (Brando) is attending a wedding for his daughter Connie. When Johnny (Vito's godson) wants his help in playing a part in a film, he sends a man named Tom to LA to get the part secured for him. One of the executives refuses and wakes up some time later with the severed head of a horse under his blankets. Later, around Christmastime, Vito and his family cause more crime-related incidents when someone asks him to inject more money into a drug business, which Vito turns down. One of Vito's men is strangled to death when he is sent to see what they're up to. Later, Vito is shot outside, but survives. His oldest son Sonny is now in control of the family, and his other son Michael (Al Pacino) kills two guys in a restaurant after retrieving a handgun from a bathroom that was placed there earlier. Violence erupts between Vito's family and a rival gang, which leads to many of his relatives fearing for their lives. Michael travels to Sicily, and Sonny is murdered by people armed with machine guns when he tries to kill a rival. Meanwhile in the mediterranean, Michael meets a girl named Apollonia, but she's killed when a bomb hidden in a car blows up. Vito now realizes he's in serious trouble as his rivals were able to find and kill Sonny. Basically admitting defeat, he tells the rival gang he will not oppose their heroin operation and will not take revenge for Sonny's demise. Michael marries his longtime girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) after returning home, but by the mid 50s, Vito's time is running out. He soon suffers a heart attack, and Corleone gangsters murder the rival mob bosses in New York City, all of this taking place on the same day as the baptism of Connie's child. With this accomplished, Michael is now in charge of the Corleone family, and is ready to fulfill his task of becoming just as feared as his father was. There are so many reasons why this movie is incredible that I can't possibly fit them all into a review, but one reason is that the opening wedding ceremony was recorded a few minutes from where I live. I'm not going to say where it is, but it's easy enough to find out. The casting and acting here is all remarkable, with the most prominent being Brando and Al Pacino. It's thanks to their stellar performances as Vito and Michael respectively that cemented both of them as gangster icons for decades to come. Of course, Brando was in tough guy movies before this, but The Godfather is such an enormous movie with so many different paths to take that it really elevated his status in the public eye. I've said it before but I'll say it again here. Only the very best movies can make an audience sad, smile, laugh, scared, etc. Within the confines of one story. The Godfather accomplishes all of these things. The music in this movie also fits perfectly with whatever is going on, and the theme song (I think everyone will agree) is one of the best tunes ever connected to a movie. There's many other things to discuss in detail, but if I attempted to, I'd be writing this until next year. The bottom line is The Godfather is like the Beatles of gangster films: it changed everything about the genre and basically became the yardstick by which other gangster movies are measured. It might not seem like a very fair comparison since nothing really tops this. As the decades pass, Don Corleone (whether its Vito or Michael) will continue to be seen as the very embodiment of the mafia. Coppola made sure the characters here were portrayed as sophisticated, and not like mindless criminals most people expected from a crime movie, which was a revolutionary decision. A movie this influential only comes once in a lifetime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ser_jorah,10,10 August 2022,"The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SeminolePhenom,10,25 July 2005,"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CinemaClown,,5 January 2016,"Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sullymazda,3,8 January 2015,"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),illbebackreviews,10,9 December 2012,"The last time I watched the Godfather I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 and I didn't particularly love it and so I was disappointed. I wasn't looking forward to sitting through this 3 hour movie once more but I'm definitely glad that I did as the second time, the whole story became so much easier to understand."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ivo-cobra8,10,17 October 2015,"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ericjg623,8,4 April 2002,"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),perica-43151,10,20 July 2018,"This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),t-turnquest1,10,20 March 2015,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sno-smari-m,10,5 October 2006,"It could be said that the film-adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel marked the beginning of a new era, as it established talents hitherto unknown to the wider public, including Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and director Francis Ford Coppola. Furthermore, THE GODFATHER is often thought of as a ""comeback"" to Marlon Brando, which apparently puzzled the actor himself, as he pointed out in his autobiography that he'd been doing movies without considerable intermission for the last twenty-or-so years. However, the claim may not have been so unreasonable after all, as the role of Vito Corleone made Brando truly sought-after again. By the time Brando embarked on the role, no major studios would hire him due to a reputation for being ""impossible"" to work with, and Coppola was only able to convince Paramount that the actor was simply tailor-made for the part and could not be neglected by having him do a screen-test first. Considering that Brando had once revolutionized acting in America through his raw, unmasked portrayals of Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy in the 1950's, this procedure may sound shocking, but once accomplished, Brando proved that he remained the king of acting in the end. His portrayal of Corleone may strike us as being somewhat of a caricature today, as it has been endlessly imitated (and parodied) since, but Brando did in fact attribute the character with far more attention to complex detail than seen in a typical movie ""gangster-boss"" up till that time. That Brando's performance has now, in the eyes of younger generations such as my own, turned somewhat into a cliché is simply the inevitable result of his initial originality."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Wiizardii321,10,15 March 2015,"So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lee_eisenberg,10,16 July 2005,"When people think of ""The Godfather"", they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling ""The Godfather"" a Mafia movie is like calling ""The Odyssey"" a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tfrizzell,,24 March 2004,"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidburrows89,7,23 September 2013,Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),miguelsanchez9753,5,6 October 2007,"Given the rave reviews, I was very excited when I finally had time to sit down and watch this movie start to finish. I ended up more than a little disappointed. My biggest complaint is that the movie glorifies the underworld in a way that ends up seeming very corny--one scene features a bunch of civilized looking crime lords sitting around a table talking about how gambling, alcohol, and prostitution are OK, but drugs cross the line."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GusF,10,23 May 2015,"Today, I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps in my film knowledge by watching one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed films of all time. I had picked up some of it by osmosis through references and parodies in other works but most of it was completely new to me, I'm glad to say. The acting, writing and direction are all of an extraordinarily high standard. It is a wonderfully told epic tale of family, betrayal, vengeance and a twisted sense of honour. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maryolalov,8,28 January 2019,There are many mafia movies out there but The Godfather truly stands out among them. And it is not great just because it is one of the first movies in the crime genre but also because of it's great cinematography and outstanding storytelling .

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BA_Harrison,10,6 March 2016,"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bbabb13,10,8 January 2016,I cannot think of a single negative of the Godfather. It truly is a classic and will always be one of the greatest films ever made. I have seen it many times and recently purchased the movie so that I could watch it anytime that I want. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oneblip,9,30 September 2006,I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),classicsoncall,10,28 November 2009,"Lately it seems, ""The Godfather"" has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don't see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I've never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it's theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There's a good reason why. I don't think there's ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the 'sleeps with the fishes' calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn't Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ccthemovieman-1,9,14 June 2006,"Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn't quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it's understandable. It also has a memorable score."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aliciadipesto,4,5 September 2005,Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mjneu59,10,22 November 2010,"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dalton2,10,2 August 1998,"What can I say about this film? In my opinion it's the best film ever made in movie history. Everything in it is perfect, the elements are combined in a brilliant way, and the result is a beautiful piece of art, a masterpiece. My rating is 10 of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RossRivero99,10,16 January 2015,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made because to me it was a pitch perfect mafia film that definitely compares to the greatness of Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990), and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) but so much better than those two great films put together. The best summary for this film would be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time is going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone family leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al Pacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s best supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having the most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films talk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in common is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can be in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood this film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by Brando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo. Coppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some instances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the perfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really disagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando rejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he gave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola didn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think he deserved it. But in the end this film is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GeorgeRoots,10,30 August 2014,"Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. ""The Godfather"" is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter's Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse's head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),utgard14,10,15 July 2014,"The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TxMike,,12 December 2004,"I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one."

I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Kpmtaxes,10,30 June 2013,"I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),L_film_N,10,2 April 2015,"Incredible!! With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and directing this movie has to be considered THE best of all time. Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDb's 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable. Nobody could've known that Marlon Brando, with two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic history."

( You've Got Mail - Tom Hanks and horse head scene, Serendipity, Everybody Loves Raymond, and even in the animated movie Zootopia and so on and so on) But after watching all 3 Parts over the course of 3 consecutive nights I can assure you, as I have also read from others, I won't be watching this again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zakcarroll-93753,5,8 June 2022,"The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gab-14712,9,18 October 2017,"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LeonLouisRicci,10,7 July 2013,"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmad-samara,10,13 February 2015,"This type of movies which you get to watch over and over again without getting bored of it, they way it has been scripted, acted, produced and directed is really attractive and amazingly catching your breath, it has a lot of life lessons to learn from no matter what do you do in your life, it also shows the importance of family bonding and keeping it all balanced. I'm convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I don't even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully we'll get to see more and more of these awesome titles."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bobsgrock,10,17 November 2009,"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dbrougham-09647,7,18 June 2022,"A timeless classic with some excellent acting and photography. Al Pacino delivers a great performance as does an ageing Brando. Interesting plot that keeps you hooked - violent and without morals which makes it a difficult watch at times. Stylish in production and excellent period scenes with great costumes and sets. The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),evanston_dad,9,29 April 2005,"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mullahk3,10,4 February 2006,"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EThompsonUMD,10,26 September 2008,"The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction.

Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered: 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),whystone2001,3,30 January 2019,One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. All these good reviews they must have watched a different movie than I did. Just a bunch of crap and talking which you can hardly understand cuz one guy talks with his mouth full the whole movie and then a lot of Italian. Just a really suckkkky movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eamon-hennedy,10,28 October 2003,"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jimmycerf,10,15 September 2014,"The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),clarahevia9,10,3 February 2015,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sh_ayush15,10,14 November 2015,"This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Stud-12,7,21 August 1999,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),invisibleunicornninja,4,16 December 2018,How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bosoxfan7191,10,29 October 2005,"This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many ""books""(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rickting,10,11 May 2014,"The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of them all and it's not difficult to see why. It is a bit cliché to like this movie, but it really does deserve it. Al Pacino plays the son of the head of a crime family who, following an assassination attempt on his father, rises up to become the head of the family, despite previously wanting nothing to do with his family's criminal activities. Aside from the slightly excessive length and the fact that the film made the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack And Jill even more painful, The Godfather is one of the few films which could be seen as borderline perfect. Like many great movies, it requires patience. The film draws its audience in slowly as it gets better and more intense as it progresses and by the extremely sad ending there is a sense of awe and genuine astonishment at the quality and power of the movie. It beats Citizen Kane, the other general choice for the best movie ever made. One of the first things to set it apart is the amazing cast, although Marlon Brando is a bit difficult to understand."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeffreyfoster,10,4 September 2015,"The first Godfather movie may be over 43 years old but still holds up well after all of these years. The film is at heart a story of family. It is the story of Vito Corleone and his three sons, Santino (Sonny), Frederico (Fredo), and Michael. It is also the story of Vito's other family, the mafia. The story focuses on Michael, the youngest son. At first, he wants nothing to do with the family business but as the film progresses, he is drawn more and more into it and by the end, he is running the family - both families. The transformation of Michael from family outcast to Godfather is fascinating to see. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of transforming from playful young man to fearsome gangster. Without going into too much detail so as not to ruin the movie for those few who have never seen it, several scenes stand out: The horses head is probably the most famous, or infamous, and has been used in homage and parody by many others in the years since the movie was released. When I rank the best movies I have seen, the original Godfather is always number one on my list."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tedojanelize,10,17 December 2015,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),evanbenlian,10,14 December 2015,"The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeancarloros,10,1 December 2015,"The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sausagebrigade,5,31 July 2003,"The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way."

Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather""."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ibuk,10,13 November 2008,"Adapted from a Mario Puzo novel, The Godfather has had the most extreme change in views for me, until a couple of weeks I despised it but that was before I rewatched it and now I love it. I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),butchfilms,10,6 November 2008,"I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RainDogJr,10,26 December 2008,"A family, the Don, everyone knows him, everyone knows of his power, here is the end of his era and simply the beginning of another, we a fantastic look into a family, into a style of life. It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, ""nothing personal"", here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new ""chapter"" in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse.

James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie?

It is the strongest movie i have ever seen .This movie gave a clear and transparent view of ""The Mafia Family"".This movie defines what cinema is(are).Four Thumbs Up!!!! for ""The Godfather"" and i hope everybody who watches this movies falls in love with it. Marlon Brando,i got no words for his appreciation what shall i tell him ""The Real Godfather of Actors"" yes that would be very less to call him so he is above that also. He was born to do Don Vitto Corleone and Don Vitto Corleone was written for him only.Al Pacino,ah what a strong Performance speechless,boundless loved him as Michael Corleone The real Son of The Godfather just can say this.and James Caan,Robert Duvall and Diana Keaton are also the important part without them ""The Godfather"" would be incomplete.just wanna say watch it"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elias-90928,10,25 July 2015,"""The Godfather"" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values ​​of life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy. This is my favorite movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Gustavo071,10,21 August 2015,"One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hlycmt,10,27 October 2015,"I liked it a lot. It's truly a masterpiece. I thought he cast was well priced and he director did a phenomenal job at directing this film. I also think the sequel is as good as the first, if not better. If I could give this film more than 10 stars right now, I honestly would. I remember going with my boyfriend to see it, for it is his favorite film. He laughed and cried and wanted to see it again and again. I am the same exact way. I not only likes this movie, but I loved it, and I still do. Even now when I see a grandfather clock I always think of this movie. Actually, writing this review right now is giving me so many amazing and beautiful memories of the movie that I want to go and see it again. I would truly recommend see this movie as soon as possible. I'm sure you wouldn't regret it. It made me the person I am today."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shahkhawar,10,14 July 2015,This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kingsholmen,7,12 February 2023,"It contains good actors, effects, sounds, music & direction but its not a film that should be considered as the best film of all time. I can watch it over again and think its good or great but i think that a movie like this should have 8,0 - 8,4 at imdb. And not 100 on metacritic. Or 97% on rt."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amesmonde,,19 March 2010,"Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),andreiapepo-85369,4,23 April 2018,"I watched this movie three times in an attempt to see why such a poorly written, directed, and acted movie is so revered by fans and critics alike.
Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed.
And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid.
The only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them. And the mafia forced critics to praise this title by placing severed horse heads in their beds!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vladislavbalayan,10,7 September 2015,Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sas_ribeiro,10,18 August 2015,"As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ReviewBuff,10,3 August 2015,This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ainidemant,10,29 July 2015,you need to watch it to understand how excellent this movie is. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yeahclowns,10,18 August 2015,"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),m-golshani32,10,31 July 2015,I Think this film is best in cinema history.one awesome film. alpacino was great in film i like his play Brando was strong kind and square!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kaimgoedecke,10,8 August 2015,"In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),morino-59166,10,9 April 2020,"First, I've read and heard about this movie for a looong time before I watched it, and I heard alot of people talking about how they are crazy about this film, I couldn't know why all these people are talking about this movie as it is an invention that changed the history of cinema??all of these questions in my head had stopped suddenly when I watched it , I can't think of better performance for the whole line of actors like this one, what shocked me to the depth of my heart actually is that you are confused about who is the best actor in this masterpiece??
The Don,Micheal,santino, clemenza or even Bonasera in the very iconic intro scene.
The characters, the cinematography, the sound track looks fabulous .
I can't really imagine how Francis Coppola managed to gather all this cast together most of them were unknown to us.
This movie is really a masterpiece and it is a reference for acting, directing, writing and everything else in the cinema business."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),selenagw-64725,7,4 November 2022,"I honeslty found this movie to be pretty overrated. The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nlytnd_1,5,16 April 2021,"I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samwellcross,10,8 September 2015,"I was searching through the reviews of this film and came across a couple that weren't particularly complimentary about the film. Firstly I have to say that this film is not my favourite film of all time, but is definitely in my top 3. Secondly, one person seemed to take offence of Marlon Brando's performance, that in itself is an insult as Brando was incredible in this film. Coppola's direction and attention to detail are inch perfect for me. The whole cast was brilliant in particular Al Pacino who gives an Oscar worthy performance of epic proportions. You don't just watch this film for me, you experience a whole new chapter of life that most would never experience through this film. The word epic can be overused in terms of film but this is 100% an epic of epic proportions. I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion but get with it man, you don't get films better than this and I refuse to believe that people who have rated the likes of 'Django unchained' as close in terms of quality to this film should be allowed to comment on film in general. 10/10!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AndreFilip,10,17 July 2015,"As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnpap8,10,25 October 2015,One of the greatest stories ever told through film. From the cinematography to the cast there isn't a single flaw.The performance by Marlon Brando is just stunning and Al Pacino amazes with his talent with this being one of his first movies. The legacy of this movie and the way it has affected cinema cant be described in words. Being a fan of organized crime movies I can say that this is my absolute favorite and I cant remember how many times I have watched it.It might be a bit long but It never ceases to amaze the viewer with its brilliant dialogue and excellent cinematography.I would like to thank personally everyone who worked on this achievement of a film. A must see for everyone who has even the slightest appreciation for cinema!!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),efsanedilcan,10,5 June 2015,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),monikahlon,9,10 October 2017,"The first movie I've ever watched that left me with the feeling that I saw something bigger than just a movie. I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that's what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can't refuse!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Clockwork_Orange55,10,11 October 2015,"I can understand on why ""The Godfather"" is being regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, if not the greatest by some professionals. ""The Godfather"" is the soul of a perfected cinema, one that will be looked upon by passionate students, and one that will be studied for generations. It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"". Even its formidable sequel never holds the same kind of stature. To admire ""The Godfather"", is to celebrate American cinema, or just simply movies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mhamaddarin,10,14 August 2015,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and Marlon Brando's performance is absolutely flawless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iceskergirl123,10,24 September 2015,"Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ameyakannur-03300,7,17 May 2020,"This movie is a great piece of work no doubt about that. The acting is natural, the direction is good and cinematography even better. When they say that every frame is a painting...they mean it. And the brilliantly exicuted deaths of whoever dies in this movie.
But
The problem is that it didn't match the hype for me.
It was suggested to Me by my friend and he said that this was the best movie he had ever saw. As he had seen a lot of movies I decided to watch this movie. This movie is boring in some parts and not completely interesting throughout. I finished this movie in 5 sittings. The scenes are unnecessarily dragged for no reason at all.
And I tried hard to really root for the characters which didn't happen in my case.
The bgm is great.....but to use the same bgm again and again got me irritated."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eronavbj,5,24 February 2002,I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),filmnyc-165-275026,10,30 September 2015,"The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gabriellbb-76895,10,7 August 2015,"Just an amazing movie with an awesome script! One of the best stories ever told. The way this story is told is something that I couldn't expect, with so much drama but also the reality of that world. We feel so connected with the family, with the characters. The photography increase the drama of the movie. Like the last take, we want so much to see how his going to be with all that power. Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It's also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different. Very honest with the book. Almost three hours that we can't feel. I wish there were more movies like this these days."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cuthwy,10,12 August 2015,I grew up watching this movie and it's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie is a gangster classic that every film buff should watch.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lloyd00,10,30 August 2015,"This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The perfects book's perfect adaptation. The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing. And don't forget Nino Rota's melodies which are inseparable from the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joshgst,10,30 September 2015,"This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gerardfarre,10,11 October 2015,"This has to be a masterpiece for me and for my understanding and knowledge. I adore mob films like this one and TV series about the mob as the great TV series I've ever watched: The Sopranos. The shooting of the whole film is sublime, and the shots of the two sequels as well. Coppola got to manage this as a master of film composing. The plot and the development in general is majestic too. The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that. Now I can only say that this has become one of my favorites films ever (for me and for most of you who are reading this). This is the sort of films that I would watch for many times."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tomimt,7,10 February 2006,"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zachary_a_erickson-26701,5,23 February 2018,This is over done and over rated. It sucks.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TJBullz93,10,19 February 2020,"This movie is simply perfect. Whether it's the acting, scenery, pacing or anything else, it's all just so brilliantly executed. Every scene is so memorable, that I just can't think of any reason to rate this movie lower than a 10/10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AlexVlad14,10,6 February 2015,"The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AnkAgarwal,10,13 February 2015,"I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cubiegirl,10,2 June 2002,"I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself.  Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time.  Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character.  Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect.  After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3.  Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jennakristiina,10,6 April 2016,"The Godfather is not just a crime film, it's much more deeper than that. It's about loyalty, respect and more than anything, it's about family and real life. The casting in this movie is flawless. Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a perfect casting choice. He brings his unique style to his character and makes him alive. He's not just acting his role, he's living it, at least that's what it feels like. He truly deserves his Best Actor Oscar. Every scene where he is in and every line he says is emotionally touching and breathtaking, and it's not just because of his acting, but it's also because of the film's magnificent writing and directing. The storyline is outstanding. It's based on a novel written by Mario Puzo. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job with bringing his story to the screen. He really gave us the best film of all time. Brando wasn't the only one who did a wonderful job with his character, because even though Vito Corleone was the key element of the movie, the movie was still mostly about his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. You can really see his character develop during the movie, and you can feel the respect that his character has toward his father. There's a real connection between those two, even though they have a small number of scenes together. Besides Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, there were other supporting roles that were amazing as well, like James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and of course the beautiful Diana Keaton as Kay Adams. This movie has everything. Good acting, directing, writing, cinematography and of course memorable and recognizable music by Nino Rota. In my opinion, there is only one misstep in this film, and that is the lighting in the wedding scene in the beginning of the movie. I can honestly say that this is my favorite movie and if you haven't seen it yet, you should watch it as soon as possible! 10/10 Excellent!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),george.schmidt,10,31 March 2003,"THE GODFATHER (1972) **** Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, John Marley, Talia Shire, Richard Conte, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Al Martino, Alex Rocco. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley ""an offer he can't refuse"" resulting with a horse's head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan's hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of ""Bonnie and Clyde"") and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael's' godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life). Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor (all losing to Joel Grey in ""Cabaret""). Kudos also to make-up guru Dick Smith for his realistic old age make up on Brando and also to Nina Rota's famous haunting foreboding score."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),uzziek,10,7 January 2006,"Well what superlatives can i give a movie that probably has had them all. This film is and will remain a classic in any era. Up step Al Pacino, from virtually nowhere this actor, amongst a frighteningly illustrious cast, absolutely blows them away and gives a performance that has given him legendary status."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kenjha,10,27 December 2008,"The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brefane,6,26 November 2009,"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kgenev,2,26 July 2006,"I read ""The Godfather"" novel, it was one of the best books that I have ever read. Not one minute in the story was I not entertained or interested. I was very excited to see how Frances Ford Coppola's collaboration with Mario Puzo, the author of the book, would translate this into a movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jm-deblois,10,11 May 2008,"The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dinadinovska,10,18 November 2015,"One of the best movies I have ever see, and I love it everything about this movie. Nothing in this movie is too much, every scene in the movie is perfect. The movie is with best cast ever, best directing, good story. It is about crime, family and their relationship. The best thing about it is that movie don't have any flaw. The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ManuElBlanco,10,29 April 2008,"Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrcarmack,10,13 February 2015,"It has been said so many times that it seems cliché, but I wil continue to say it. The Godfather is one of he greatest movies ever made. Words cannot express how well the film combines all the elements a film needs, to be good. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shaun_sat,10,29 March 2015,"Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),qprmal,10,10 May 2008,"I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife ""Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?"" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),colinsiterecruitment,10,22 December 2015,"What's to say about this movie that hasn't been said already. Pure cinema magic. The casting is superb, the character development is superb, the acting is first class, coupled with the legendary soundtrack a true masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Leon_Chang_2000,7,29 July 2004,"After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MovieAlien,1,16 February 2002,"I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as ""#1"" on the IMDb."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ackstasis,10,6 March 2009,"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mclozap,10,4 November 2005,"id just like to say that i think that this film is fantastic. i was never interested in in before and thought that it would be rubbish- i was wrong! i had to watch it for my film studies A-level and am so glad that i did, as i would have otherwise missed out on a great film. the film as a whole is amazing, but my favourite part is when Solozzo is murdered by Michael. i believe that this scene is shot fantastically, especially in the way that it creates tension and suspense and the audience is unsure as to whether or not Michael will actually do it. this is the first step that Michael makes to becoming involved in the gangster world. i also love the closing sequence of this film, when Michael has Carlo killed. once again this scene was shot fantastically, especially the way in which the light was positioned on Michaels face. this was that half was dark and the other light. i believe that this was to show how Michael had changed as a character, and that he was now fully apart of the gangster world, being the Don en' all. you can now see that Michael is a cold and heart-less character, and at the very end when the door is shut on his wife Kate this leaves the audience wanting to know what happens next. i haven't watched the godfather part 2 yet, but i know i have too as apparently it is even better than this film, which i find hard to imagine. but i cant wait to see how Micheal's life develops."

Godfather was written first with a unique way, that made you more interested to see the man's life, who can change you life, or even make your life in past with a word. For me it started with the DOP, with the amazing picture. Decoration, accessories, the site, and really the performance of all these stars together. Music was amazing and much matching the time of the movie, specially when you do your search of the music of that time. Last and least, the Director, who controlled all of his tools and made this great movie, i never felt bored of watching it."

The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),limitajans,10,20 February 2022,Truly one of the best movie series in the world. Great quality acting and script... It's impossible to forget. This will never happen again. Don Vito Corleone.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),foxtografo,7,14 January 2021,"I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion.
The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition.
But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive...
Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CinefanR,1,30 April 2012,"I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but since I like Al Pacino and I've heard so much about this so-called ""legendary"" Godfather, I decided to give it a try. I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dquallos,10,19 July 2022,"Es they are worth watching. If you like the slow dramas, then the Godfather is for you. There isn't A LOT happening, as in not much action, a lot of talking. But superb acting and an impeccable story."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mtpzrpzw,10,2 April 2022,"Unlike a lot of older movies, The Godfather is packed with action and plot. The plot moves at lightening speed - honestly my only critique is that it moves TOO fast! Great characters, interesting plot, lots of action. While there is a small amount of racism and the entire movie is male focused, The Godfather holds up relatively well for its age."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OguzhanDorul,9,10 September 2020,"A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble.
A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brysonwinnlds,10,11 July 2022,I've never seen a movie that can move me the way the Godfather could. Crime movies try so hard to attain what the godfather did but fail miserably. Unfortunately in the day and age of remakes and sequels I don't see any movie ever topping this again.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),t.franco,9,2 April 2002,"I can't really describe accurately  how I feel about this movie. I have seen it so many times and every time I have enjoyed it more than the previous one. The plot, the music, the actors and actresses couldn't have played better roles. This movie was even better than the book which rarely happens in with other movies. No wonder why it movie has been ranked first."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),irishm,6,19 April 2013,"I finally watched this movie, and I just don't get the hype. I didn't dislike it, and the violence didn't bother me, but I found it over-long and very, very slow. I'm a 50-something who doesn't demand a break-neck pace in a film, even an ""action"" film I'm used to watching long movies that take some time to unfold, and I don't mind that. I have patience. But ""The Godfather"" just seemed to be moving at the wrong pace for its subject matter. I never got into it. I finished it, but I didn't feel drawn into their world."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),setanta-,1,18 January 2002,"I remember distinctly the first time I saw ""The Godfather"". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Reel1120,10,27 October 2023,"My father would watch this on vhs, recorded off cable, often. He was born in the 30s, grew up during the depression and world war 2. This film depicts an America that he lived through and with authenticity. Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece here. Attention to every detail pays off. A master class in storytelling. Think of Enzo the baker. A minor scene in the very beginning regarding Enzo is actually an introduction to an important element at the scene at the hospital. Enzo shows up to bring flowers and Michael uses him to help ward off assassins, which leads to McCluskey assaulting Michael and in turn leads to.... Well, you know. A film as well written, well acted, well filmed, paced etc. As The Godfather is as rare as anything. Hyperbole aside, this is a true twentieth century American masterpiece in film making. Every film that came after it owes a debt of gratitude. Deserving of all the praise that had been bestowed upon it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),petermiller-25070,10,23 January 2024,"The Year was 1972. The Vietnam War still had 2 more years before it was finally over, Star Wars was probably being written by George Lucas while he was prepping American Graffiti, Watergate was on American peoples minds, Russel Crowe was 8 years old and as for me...........well, i was not even a Glitch in my mothers Womb. That was the Year when a movie came out that was something Special, a movie that we still talk about today and even some might call the greatest film of all time. That was the year of The Godfather!!!!! Francis Ford Copolla directed one of the true cinema greats, and after almost 40 years, its still remains a fine example of a movie that sucks you in from beginning to end and leaves you satisfied like no other film like it. Marlon Brando 'makes you an offer you cant refuse' as Don Vito Corleone, the Head of his Family and Godfather. Brando is such a fine Actor and brings great weight to his role as the Don. Also great is James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot tempered son and Al Pacino as the young son Micheal Corleone, who at first does not want to get involved with the family Business until he has no choice. With other great actors like Robert Duvall and Dianne Keaton, the Godfather is a great ensemble that ended up winning a very deserving Best Picture at the Oscars and best Actor for Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo wrote the Screenplay, and its sizzling with Classic Lines and memorable moments. This film, like the old Cagney films before it, paved the way for some other great Gangster Flicks that came rolling along through the years after it, but this stands on the top of the Mountain as the Godfather of all them......"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),divyanshukashyap-75334,10,13 December 2021,"The Godfather is truly the godfather of movies. Whether its the acting, the music, the cast, screenplay...everything is spot on and credit to Francis Ford Coppola for not only directing this but also choosing to stick with a new comer like Al Pacino where as the production wanted a household name, casting Brando and setting the story in New York despite being nearly fired on 3-4 occasions. And boy did it pay off, They would go on to earn their own Oscar nominations and wins for ""The Godfather.""
The movie is.3 hours long & slow paced but still there is no dull moment in the movie. A treat for movie lovers with legends of cinema."

Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end?  If so, you've seen 90% of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not ""best movie ever material."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tomflinn123,10,24 February 2020,Really like this one. Must watch for any fans off mafia films. Will watch again.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joeflemming,9,5 September 2018,Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s. This is a must watch for any person who appreciates cinema.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),itsmeibrah,10,8 June 2021,I think this is the best film ever done. All the actors did so well in the film..Specially Brando and Al Pacino won my heart.. I can see more than 100 times and still not boar.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BeatlesFan3287,10,15 September 2009,"When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anshulsingh-42733,10,28 November 2022,"This film shows an Italian Mafia Carleone headed by Don Vito, The Godfather. You are lucky if he is your friend, but if he is your enemy then you are dead. The film starts with his daughter's wedding introducing all other characters. Here comes our main lead Micheal who is a simple guy who doesn't want to get involved in the family business. There are other Mafia families equally powerful to Don Vito's family. One guy Sollozzo, who wants to start his drug business under the protection of Godfather. But Don Vito who is a good mafia rejects this deal as drug business is against his principles. This act of rejection starts a gang war among mafia families involving great atrocities which affects even the Corleone family. Micheal also gets involved in this war due to family emotions and other reasons. This movie is a great piece of art with great acting, action, drama and with spices of surprises."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zanderliaw,9,8 May 2022,"I wasn't born when the movie came out, but grew up hearing how the older generations praise the film to be the greatest film ever made. And I agreed, it was deep, it was majestic. But it wasn't really as legendary as you'd expect, especially when we compare it with the movies we see nowadays. However, the movie was made in 1972 and there probably wasn't much choice back then."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),martingega,10,19 January 2020,"This is the greatest movie ever made, I'm not joking. I have watched a lot of movies, movies with more oscars and not a single one is better than this. The story, the casting, even the soundtrack is perfect."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),almuktadirkhan,6,18 January 2019,Don't understand what is so special about the movie. Certainly doesn't deserve to be the best movie ever.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maliceinwonderland88,1,24 August 2006,"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named ""The Best Movie of All Time."""

It's hard to fine a movie done this well, it's 29 times old and has progressed well. Indeed if the bystander doesn't like cabal type of pictures, he or she'll watch the entire film, the cult is fused to what will be next as the film progresses. Its about, family, fidelity, rapacity, connections, and real life. This is a great blend, and the cultural style make the film memorable."

The writing, directing, acting, soundtrack, cinematography....everything about the film is an A+. I've seen it so many times and I'm such a movie buff that I've made it my life's goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty. I've heard the runtime criticized, but there are no superfluous parts to the movie that deserve cutting. I can only hope that we someday see a film that measures up, but won't hold my breath. Bravo."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),martinabantik,10,12 December 2021,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zml-90083,9,27 May 2020,"The movie is very old. When I watched this movie, I was still young. I didn't understand the truth. When I grew up and watched it again, I really had a taste"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nmaslosky,7,22 March 2022,Definitely the most overrated movie ever. It's not bad but it's pretty slow. I've tried and failed to make it all the through it many times but I always fall asleep. Perfect example of a classic that's surviving on nostalgia. I'm sure for it's time it was revolutionary. Reminds me of when older folks talk about their favorite athletes from the past. Sure some of them are all time greats but let's be honest most of them just can't keep up with modern times. I'm 34 years old for reference in case I come off sounding like a child.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mbuchwal,1,15 February 2006,"Does ""Godfather"" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name ""Corleone"" which translates as ""Lionhearted,"" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mikikg-12538,10,15 May 2021,"When you see it on TV, you get the offer you can't refuse. Godfather is the greatest movie ever. Acting, music, directing, photography, everything is perfect. Movie without a mistake. Real masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marco_mct,10,15 August 2018,This is more than a gangster movie this is a pure masterpiece.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),georgecretuu1,10,10 December 2022,"Francis Ford Coppola's first film in the series is still an epic, full of hypnotic acting, which reinvented mafia criminals as players in a dynastic psychodrama. This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks and he sees no other ways than to step in and fight for his family; if you watched Scarface and you liked Tony Montana, than you'd like Michael as well. This is a masterpiece and I think everyone would love Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone making the story so good."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kearneyro,9,11 March 2019,"Here it is, the big boss man Vito is sitting in his gold chair, petting his cat, showing power. The poor man is begging for money from Vito but Vito just taunts him. This is one of the first scenes and probably one of the greatest scene in the movie because it shows how dramatic the movie is by the Vito showing power and wealth by petting a cat and sitting in a gold chair."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),random753,10,12 June 2023,I first expected from this movie to be massively overrated but after I watched I was amazed. In my opinion is the third best movie ever made. It has action and you can't get bored while watching it. It's a three hours long movie but not a single minute was boring. This is definitely the best movie about gangsters and I loved the action. I also liked the fact that this movie is not all about gunshots and stuff like this. It shows us the problems that the Corleone family has to deal with and I was just amazed by the plot. It could be a little bit shorter because some scenes are unnecessary in my opinion but as I said it is definitely not boring. It gets a 10/10.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SteelVengeance,10,27 May 2020,"The Godfather deserves all the love it gets with its fantastic acting, story, suspense, character development, music, and direction. This is the highest standard of film making, Francis Ford Coppola was a genius with his direction in this one and the second. This is a gangster film like no other, the perfect combination. Its like having your favorite food at your favorite restaurant in your favorite city, everything is perfect, from the front and center details to the small and minor ones."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mr-Fusion,9,7 March 2017,"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Karimousa,10,2 May 2016,"If you think again, you will realize that writing a review about The Godfather is quite stupid! This is a movie, every person in this world should have seen before death! I cannot understand people who do not like this movie!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Boyo-2,7,18 June 2004,"I saw this for the first time as a teenager and was pretty bored.  At the same time I was seeing things like ""Scarecrow"" and ""Deliverance"" so its not like I was just interested in seeing juvenile nonsense. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mikelogan,1,1 April 2002,I saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters.  It was the first movie I seriously considered walking out of.  Up to that point in my life I had never fidgeted so much in a movie.  I blame the director - his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and I could hardly wait for it to be over. The whole Godfather series is vastly overrated.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hmael,10,1 November 2020,"This movie is surpassed only by its sequel Godfather 2, but of course there would not have been The Godfather 2 without The Godfather. This movie is a heavy drama that has everything; family, loyalty, vengeance, love, business. I have watched this movie more than ten times and plan to watch it again. It's a masterpiece and will linger in your mind long after you finish watching it. Great all around performances from major actors. I love this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kaandogusoy-377-467302,9,23 April 2020,"Visuals, story, acting, directing, musics... this is basically the maximum directors can reach. shawshank redemption is a great movie but it's lacking in many such as visuals. If I meet an alien and they ask me what's the best movie you guys ever made, I would give them this and say second one is almost as good as the first one."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kalinaadrian,10,11 July 2022,A must watch movie for all about the inner workings of a mafia family. Brilliant performance by Marlon Brando.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jzappa,10,4 October 2008,"The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bored_Dragon,8,17 October 2018,"I finally set out to take three hours to watch ""the best movie ever"" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),callanvass,10,1 January 2005,"It is indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there, however best movie of all time i would have to say no. It does indeed deserve it's reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it's very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It's a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone's bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino's performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino's wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don't go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erikalizbeth-66965,7,20 July 2019,"This movie isnt that good but it's definitely not bad. Everyone talks about this movie like it's some masterpiece but quite frankly it's boring in some scenes, got to so bored the first time watching that I stopped watching a few times that day."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jojofla,1,5 August 2002,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"".  I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anewave,10,26 August 2008,"The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime ""family"" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch ""Don"" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Silician immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American ""families"" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime ""family,"" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Quinoa1984,10,19 February 2000,"The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),satankitty13,10,8 July 2008,"The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),daveisit,9,29 November 2000,"""The Godfather"" is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),phil-mach,10,6 June 2005,"From the opening credits, you become completely immersed in the world of the Godfather. One of this film's greatest strengths is the pure power of the culture surrounding it. When you watch it, you feel like the society and the people in have descended from generations of people who have been in the ""business""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),slightlymad22,8,29 January 2015,"I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think ""The Godfather"" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),troyputland,10,6 December 2015,"There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sergeantbreinholt,7,30 November 2016,"In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vegeta3986,1,7 July 2006,"This movie has to be THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME. i don't understand why everyone raves about this movie. it's boring, the acting is shallow and weak, the whole premise is annoying, and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this ""movie"". This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this ""i'll make him an offer he can't refuse"" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dexter-vane,10,16 May 2015,"No one can deny this movie being one of the (if not THE) greatest movies ever made. It is brilliant. Great performances by an amazing cast (that was controversial among the studio), beautiful music, brilliant directing of course, cinematography to die for and a storyline that fascinated me from the very first to the very last minute. The movie goes deep into the family and lets you be part of a dramatic journey. I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE. It is one of my all time favourite movies and I can watch it over and over again, finding more and more beauty in it every time. It is sad that many friends my age have never seen this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Movie-ManDan,10,3 December 2014,"Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more ""best of"" lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being ""the greatest of all time."" It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rizwan-vja,10,15 November 2008,"There might be many movies made since the inception of cinema and trust me wen i say that I have seen superb cinema of many ages and of many genres but never have I come across a movie like the Godfather. It just is the perfect synonym for cinema which can change your life.It is no secret that The Godfather has impacted so many moviegoers and made them into successful film makers or at least aspiring film makers. There are so many things which can be written about the genius of the Godfather.But the most striking thing which has to be mentioned is the perfect transition of the book onto screen.The book has been adapted so well that the movie seems better than the book in some frames.Mario Puzo and Coppola have collaborated so well that its a product of genius. Now we have heard a lot about the casting,but what can i say.I feel I am nothing to speak about the acting prowess of Marlon Brando.I have never come across a performance so spell binding with an amazing screen presence.Brando was Don Corleone will remain etched in every body's mind as the perfect man for the role. Al Pacino was simply sensational.The way he portrayed his emotions are a joy to watch on screen.His acting to me has to shown to every aspiring actor because its such a powerful act which just refuses to fade away from your memory.The supporting cast of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Cann as Sonny are exemplary. The back ground score and cinematography is of the highest class. And the dialogues are just extra ordinary.For example dialogues such as, i will make him an offer he cant refuse.I will reason with him are just so powerful but yet so subtle. Mafia was never so stylish nor powerful.It is a movie to watch for every film connoisseur because until one does not watch the God father he cannot know or cant fantasize A PERFECT MOVIE. a work of absolute Genius.I believe everybody associated with the movie is so god damn proud of himself for having his name attached to it. and I am proud of being a FANATIC of the Godfather."

In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one."

Famed director Stanley Kubrick called ""The Godfather"" a candidate for the best movie ever made and ""without a doubt, the best cast."" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct."

It has drama, action and even comedy. The story is great. It centers around the most powerful New York mafia run by The Godfather. It teaches you about family and betrayal, about life in general. All that Michael does is for his family. He even sacrifices his relationship with his girlfriend to protect his family. The movie is amazingly shot, giving it amazing light. The characters are bigger than life and played by some of the greatest actors to ever live. The soundtrack is very good. All in all is must see."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karahan-kaya,10,13 December 2015,"he Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),philerritty,9,21 April 2004,"As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Azzurrim17,10,13 August 2008,"First I would like to state that I am 20 years old this movie was made 16 years after I was born, but it is my favorite movie of all time. I really get annoyed when I hear this nonsense about young people can't judge movies because they haven't seen all the classics, well I have seen them all , Casablanca, Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront, North by Northwest and so on. I own all three of these movies, and the original is the best, 2 is very close to the original and 3 is decent. I also hate these people who judge this movie poorly because its all about Italians its pathetic I read so many comments here and everywhere that the sole basis of a poor rating is it being about Italians its a joke, Like in on the waterfront when Marlon Brando's character, transitions from a goon for organized crime to at the end of the film a changed man who wants to be a better man, Michael Corleone's character I feel is the greatest transformation in all of film history, he changes from this nice quiet military, war hero, good citizen, to a dark, ruthless, emotionless character, which he really has to do the collapse of his family. That alone i think makes this movie great, not to forget how great Marlon Brando is in this along with James Caan and Robert Duvall. This movie broke a lot of barriers in film, starting a lot of trends and setting standards for so many other mafia movies, like Goodfellas, and the Departed etc... I really think that if you have never seen it you should invest some time because you will not be disappointed."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Pjtaylor-96-138044,9,9 February 2018,"Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10"

Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amirash-46779,10,10 November 2020,Not many films stand the test of time but after almost 50 years this is still the gold standard of cinema. And rightfully so.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mcarmona,10,18 October 2003,"I'm a movie fan! I love most movies I see (except of, for example, ""Crash""), but, this one movie, for me, has everything a movie must have."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dr_foreman,7,25 June 2004,"Hollywood has some strange politics.  Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops.  Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves.  And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow).  Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),codygdietrich,1,14 April 2023,"One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. It felt like a Lifetime movie except for the angry wife seeking revenge it is angry men seeking revenge. The movie starts out with no back story to introduce the characters, who they are, where they are in life and a why to it all while introducing their goals or life plans. As the story progresses the characters do not grow as humans and develop more depth, to the contrary they go in the opposite direction they become less mature and even less human. They lose any depth they had and seem to be motivated entirely by revenge and greed. It is not an antihero story where the main character's motives and means is questionable but ultimately relatable and you feel if you were in the position you might or at least would be tempted to do the same, it's more of a childish jerk story where they seem to be very childish meaning impulsive, over reacting and not thought out well in terms of long term consequences. It is an incredibly slow moving movie and I just finished the movie not a full 15 minutes ago and if you were to show me a picture of a character and ask me who it is, I don't think I could tell you because the writing is so sloppy that you don't build a connection with the characters that make you care about what happens to them, as I was watching the film I was hoping for murders because it would have added some action to an incredibly slow film and because it would mean the end was nearing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mahmus,10,9 November 2020,"The Godfather can have slow scenes and plot points that might feel rushed, but it never has a single scene or plot point that feels boring, which for a fourty year old, three hour long movie with such a slow pace, is the sign of a timeless masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),liudj,8,25 October 2000,"Pretty good, but a bore at times. The plot was very good and has some turns, but overall the story unfolded very slowly. Only the actors did a great job to save the day. I was also very impressed by the music, when you closed your eyes, the music alone can put you in the story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AaronCapenBanner,10,31 August 2013,"Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted(Marlon Brando, Academy Award winner, Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall among many others) and supremely well-crafted film about the saga of the Corleones, a Mafia family who find themselves in changing times, and their struggles to adapt. Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Hey_Sweden,10,25 July 2021,"Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),g-bodyl,8,2 March 2009,"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),colm-hearne365,10,1 November 2015,"Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joshuafagan-64214,10,3 March 2016,"Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mahtabkowsari-71833,10,14 May 2015,"Godfather is one of the rare films that I watch over and over and every time I enjoy it the same as first time. It is true masterpiece in many ways from directing and acting to mesmerizing quotes and music. To me it has layers that every time I watch I find something new in it. Its interesting approach to the world of women that overshadowed under Muscular games of men mirrored the social issues of 50s in its hidden layers. The color theme in dark brown scenes reminded the Gothic era and architecture works perfectly. Men in dark rooms and covered windows taking care of their mostly illegal business. Soundtrack inspired by Italian old song comes on the task of dramatizing events moved some scenes in some scenes of violence with the hypocritical guise of characters, that lead us to a deep inferiority."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bondfish,8,23 July 2010,I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wellthatswhatithinkanyway,10,13 May 2005,STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jboothmillard,10,13 March 2005,"The most brilliant and famous gangster crime film in history. The late, great Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Marlon Brando stars as Don Vito Corleone, or The Godfather. Introduced, and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino also stars as his son, Michael Corleone. They are a family that do a lot of ""business"". The Godfather is meant to help people with problems, and solve them how ever intense or simple they are. When Vito starts to feel ill Michael has to take his place until he is better. In the end Vito dies and Michael becomes the new Godfather. Also, he eliminates all of Vito's enemies to avenge his death. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated James Caan as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone, Richard S. Castellano as Pete Clemenza, Oscar BAFTA nominated Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Sterling Hayden as Capt. Mark McCluskey, John Marley as Jack Woltz, Richard Conte as Emilio Barzini, Al Lettieri as Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams. A work of genius from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated (lost Oscar to Bob Fosse for Cabaret) director Francis Ford Coppola, with a superb sequel followed, and unfortunately the rubbish third film. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Nino Rota and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Marlon Brando was number 30, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pacino was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Brando was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Pacino was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro), and Brando number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor, Michael Corleone was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.""), it was number 5 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 46 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and along with the sequel, both were number 2 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kosmasp,10,4 February 2013,"The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show ""Sopranos"". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cricketbat,8,6 August 2018,"Overrated? Maybe a little bit, but this is really a very well-made film that features wonderful performances. The pacing of this film will drive some crazy, but The Godfather isn't afraid to take its time and let us get to know the characters. This is an iconic movie though - no doubt about that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jcucchisi-77-755989,10,22 October 2019,For me The Godfather is the best film. Everything from the music to acting and script are all perfect. The film has tons of amazing iconic lines and scenes and of course the character of Vito Corleone is amazing and Marlon Brando does an amazing job of playing him. Everything about the film is perfect.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brefane-41162,7,25 January 2016,"I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichés. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jdavisjdavis,2,29 September 2012,"If you aren't a thug lover... if you don't drool over less than smart bad guys somehow getting ahead... if you don't really like spectacle just for spectacle sake... then this movie may not be for you. To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),prekpalajmateo,8,20 January 2021,Its a good movie but it doesnt deserve the place for second best rated movie. I have seen much much better movies with 7 rate or 8.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),justafanuk,10,12 September 2003,`I believe in America' are the first words spoken in The Godfather. The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DeltaParadox,10,28 May 2008,"The Godfather has become over the years a classic and many consider it to be one of the best films ever made, this is truly deserved. Everything about the film is perfect and I simply cant think of anything that shouldn't be there as every single thing screams perfection. The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn't bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others. A true classic. 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sandeepventrapragada98,10,8 December 2019,"I've stopped watching 4 different times after the first 30mins but later one day i've decided to finish it because I've never heard great things about a film like this then happened to watch I was totally mindblown and got to know why this film is undisputed inspiration for 100's of films even after 40years of its release. It's a character driven film more than a plot driven film that's why we feel unsettling while watching the first 1 hour but as long as you travel with the characters and their emotions you can feel the magic. Can't thank enough the cast and crew for this greatest cinematic experience, I wish every movie buff will check out this film to witness how a grand masterpiece can influence their work."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emailbajaj,10,11 May 2002,"The Best Movie of All times, Al Pacino & Marlon Brando are Superb. Al Pacino as the son of the Godfather rules the second half of the movie with its excellent histronics and style. How The ruthless Michael conquers the underworld empire is perhaps the most significant tales of ever times. GodFather II equally good but III simply disappoints."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SMLA11,10,24 May 2002,"The Godfather has to be one of the greatest movies ever. Ever.  Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the don of a mafia who was injured by a shooting of another mafia.  Al Pacino is Michael Corleone, a man who just got home and is ready to take over for his injured father and do the dirty work of repaying the other mafia.  James Caan is Sonny Corleone, a raging psychopath of the family who is also ready to take over for his father before an accident happens.  A big accident.  Francis Ford Coppola is the greatest director.  He created a true gem of a movie and I loved this every second. he proved he can direct wonderful movies and he started it here.  the acting was wonderful from everybody.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, etc. everybody was awesome."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PatrickRiley71,10,27 April 2014,"This may be regarded as the best film of the entire history of cinema, it is almost perfect in all respects, photography, script, editing, all with great technique and art at the same time, I find it significant errors."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dcldan,10,23 May 2007,"What can I say about ""the godfather"" that has not been said before? That it is a masterpiece? That its staff is just wonderful? That the actors and soundtrack are superb? That it is considered one of the best films ever? Actually I don't know what more say, but it is true that it is hard to see more deserved good marks. I had never the opportunity of watching to it in original version and, when I did it, I could perfectly realize the fabulous wonder I was able to enjoy, Marlon Brando is just impressive, Al Pacino is as good as him, and James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton deserved to be congratulated. Thanks to Coppola, for giving us the pleasure of watching ""the Godfather"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Doylenf,7,6 August 2006,"Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),costasilvad,1,28 March 2022,"Overrated movie that romanticizes the mafia. Script is average, the performances and scenography are good, but they don't wash away the weak script. Don Vito Corleone is just a romanticized and unbelievable mob boss."

This surely has to be one of my all time greats, beautifully acted and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in a sense that its almost ubelievable to believe that a director could achieve this. The cast line up includes Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and Diana Keaton. Marlon Brando gives an extraordinary performance as Don Voto Corleone aka the Godfather. With its breath taking story line and emotional story telling and a stellar cast.What more can you ask for this emotionally gritty drama. And the answer is nothing, because this is to as near perfect film making you are going to see. Don't MISS ME"

The way every aspect of filmmaking and storytelling compliments the other in this unforgettable film causes one to wonder ( really) if such a feat can be repeated, ever ."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ToddLargo,10,7 February 2015,"It's a bit difficult to find a part, a moment, within the film that doesn't showcase great acting, story-telling, and a heart to what it means to have honor and pride. A well deserved film. Brando's brilliance is showcased within The Godfather. Al Pacino is a the seed that is placed within the story, who continually grows throughout by the light of his father. Although, some seeds are worth pulling. The undertone of the story is the concept of corruption and the fall of an empire, and a start to a new one. Fracis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, an everlasting mark on American Cinema. Definitely a piece of history, and you're along for the ride, and experiencing the visceral feeling of that era."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),KillerLord,10,1 February 2007,"Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever?

About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),holigor,8,27 September 1999,"Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LG72387,10,14 May 2002,"The Godfather is one of the best films of all time. Marlon Brando gives a powerful performance as Don Corleone along with Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Cann, and Talia Shire. It shows the brutal strength of the mob and how they controlled things back in the day. It is truly an American classic and is hardly considered a dissappointment to many fans. The winner of 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1972 and Best Actor, The Godfather is indeed a film that any movie fanatic should see because it contains a brilliant script, powerful acting, and wonderful direction. One of my favorite lines from this film is ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" spoken by Don Corleone, signifying the power of the mob and what it can do to get what it wants. Marlon Brando's performance was so superb that he won an Oscar for it. I loved this movie! If you are any movie fanatic, you should see this movie before any other."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kingtanichi,10,16 October 2003,"The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kieran-wright,10,24 April 2015,"Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gandalf_theWise14,10,15 August 2019,"Where do you even start with a film like this? There are so many layers to The Godfather, so many little intricacies among the plot, that it is simply impossible to fully analyze this film in one review. With this in mind, I'm just going to give some of my thoughts on the film here."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Palegazer,10,24 March 2003,"The heavy storyline from ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo couldn't be better. The best acting performance you poissibly can reach, Marlon Brando does his greatest role ever as Vito. You really don't notice that the movie has some years on it's shoulders, stunning by Francis Ford Coppola. This one cannot be anything else than the highest score possible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kyle-cruse,9,19 August 2008,"I had to watch the entire trilogy and reflect on the films for a while before I realized what a great film ""The Godfather"" is. As I watched all three films, I really got familiar with all of the characters and became more intrigued as the series went on. Looking back, I felt that this first film was the greatest of the trilogy for several reasons. First of all, it has Marlon Brando, who portrays the amazing character Vito Corleone. This is one of the most memorable, imitated, and lovable characters in film history. His character is masterfully balanced as a powerful mafia patriarch and a loving family man. For this he won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar. I also prefer this film because Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is a hero rather than the villain he later becomes. As Vito Corelone is wounded by an enemy, Michael must take over leading his empire while he is recovering. The interactions between the characters is excellent here, as is the film's dialogue. There is also a great supporting cast, consisting of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and more. What a well-crafted story. Part II is almost as good, but I think this is slightly better. Close to perfect."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lnunez0306,10,14 February 2007,"Many who have viewed this film consider it one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever made. The performance by Marlon Brando is legendary and iconic. The plot development and character development by far is heads above any other film that I have have had the pleasure of seeing. What in my opinion stands out above all in this film and perhaps the most understated and unappreciated film performances ever.Al Pacino played what I believe to be the most believable and powerful performance in film history. The complexity of Michael Corleone and his slow and uncontrolled spiral into the dark side of power and influence.Never before have I seen a more complete and developed performance; it is as if you see this idealistic young man forced into a life he rejected, only to become the most ruthless and feared crime figure of all time,all the while maintaining a realism and not going over the top much like the Tony Montana Character Pacino Played in Scarface. Displaying power and intimidation with minimal effort or any threatening physical attributes Pacino is able to let us as the viewers delve deep in to the soul of this tortured young man and see the birth of power hungry perverse monster who carries himself like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It was a crime that this stellar performance was not awarded with the academy award. The first two films of this trilogy allows us to see Al Pacino reach the pinnacle of acting, closing out what might be considered the best overall character performance in a film series with a truly under appreciated and powerful performance in the Godfather Part III. Pacino's performance in the Godfather in my opinion is the single best performance in film history, and the Godfather is the greatest American film ever made."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),diand_,8,14 June 2005,In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spotdog19,8,29 September 2003,"Quite possibly the MOST over rated film in history. Never has there been so much made of so little. It is an OK movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of ""gang"" lifestyle. This movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Anonymous_Maxine,10,30 August 2001,"Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Maniac-9,10,5 August 1998,"It is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film.  Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pacino, and John Cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making. You can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cant-affordsit,10,4 April 2006,"This is the greatest movie ever made. It not only gives an interesting view on the mafia, but it teaches many valuable lessons and ideas, for which a good example is in the first scene, the meeting between the Don and Bonasera (""What did I ever do to deserve such disrespect?""). I am 13 now, and the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. The Godfather has definitely made me smarter and prepared me for the independence of being a teenager. I would recommend if your child is 8+ and has not seen this movie that they watch it right away. I have the full box set, and have seen them all numerous times. The third was disappointing though, with dry acting, repetitive plot, and many awkward moments between Sofia Coppola and Al Pacino. I was also glad that the first two movies did not have too much violence, although there is a fair amount of Thompson guns in them. I have a habit of quoting Brando, who plays a character who delivers some of the most powerful, meaningful lines in any movie I have seen. I have seen most of Brando's movies, from Streetcar to Missouri breaks to the Freshman, in which his lines are so unique and unconventionally spoken they sometimes make me laugh. It was a true shame for Brando to die at the not-too-old age of 80, although he was not in good health at the time. Although many people are sure to claim the fame that Brando accomplished, I will always remember him to be the greatest actor ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Grot,10,13 September 1998,"What a truly special movie this is. Despite its violence, heavy content, and length, I could literally watch it every week. This film contains some of the most tragic, well-devoloped characters in the history of American cinema; they are simply unforgettable. Then there are the masterful performances, the beautiful cinematography and art direction, the wonderful script, etc., etc. In short, this is one of the most perfect stretches of celluloid ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jb993681,10,15 February 2006,This movie is outstanding for a great number of reasons. Not only is the film aesthetically pleasing but the grandiose storytelling at work is a must see for any film enthusiast.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adamdobson_uk,10,11 August 2002,"As a film critic for one of the national newspapers, I often get asked the question ""what is the greatest film of all time"". For me, the answer comes naturally. ""The Godfather"". When everything is taken into account, from the acting, to the music score, it cannot be bettered. Those who contradict this cannot be as passionate about film as they think they are. Certainly there are other movies in the world, but take it from me, this is the finest piece of film-making you will ever see, it is a true epic. I will reveal nothing more, as I believe a film should be watched afresh, so that it has maximum impact. I would courteousely ask the person who wrote the page long essay on this site to restrict himself in future. Enjoy this film the very first time, enjoy it the second, indeed this is a movie that can be watched over and over, with the viewer discovering a new aspect each time. Enjoy the movie and revel in its greatness."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adolan-78718,9,23 October 2015,"I decided to read the novel before I watched this, just to allow me to write a fair critique of the movie afterwards. I would've rated this film 10/10 if during the hospital scene, the Godfather's bed rolled down the flight of hospital stairs and out the main doors, with Al Pacino and the nurse in hot pursuit. The bed would then continue to roll down the street, rapidly gaining velocity, as the mob hit men and several police officers continued in the pursuit of him. This scene would be more enjoyable if several civilians greeted The Godfather as he zoomed past them and wished him a Merry Christmas, perhaps piling presents onto the edge of his bed, happy to see he's doing well after being shot on the streets. Overall though, this was a perfect film that followed the novel closely- I don't have many complaints."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),paul2001sw-1,9,21 January 2007,"Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tveitlan,10,21 April 2003,"When I first saw The Godfather I sat speechless for about 15 mins. The movie just took my breath away. Watching the whole gang, Brando, Duvall, Pacino, Caan and the others, you just, for a few hours, forget you are watching a movie. You are sucked into their world of intrigues, love-affairs and family-business. If there is some out there who hasn't seen the movie, for some VERY strange reason, I can guarantee you, that you have missed out on the greatest movie of all time. Sure Citizen Kane was great, and so was The Shawshank Redemption, but let's be real... There is NO comparison to The Godfather. Whether you like gangster-movies or not, this is one you can't miss!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ceejaypitre,9,23 November 2023,"In my personal opinion the godfather is an amazing movie that everyone should at least once as this is a timeless classic. The godfather has a lot of good elements and storytelling that is a very good watch. My one problem with the movie is how it is rated among the community. The godfather is commonly seen among the community as the greatest movie of all time, which in my opinion is not true. Although the godfather is a movie that everyone and there grandma has watched and enjoyed, including myself I don't think it should be marked down in history as the greatest movie of all time. Even movie that have come out i the past year have been on the same level, for example oppenheimer was a really good movie that was on the same level as the godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mr-dj,10,11 July 2002,The godfather Must be the best film ever made? The story is so good and the filming by Coppola outstanding There are also so many smal details in this trilogy that are used in other films as a refferens. and the preformans of Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen)is exelent..
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tweekums,10,16 September 2019,"This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),capwillard,10,20 January 2003,"This movie if so we can call it, because is more than a movie, it's the greatest union of artist, starting with the director finishing with the composer, stepping between the actors. Even if it's not a movie made by a ""true"" Sicilian, it smells like Sicily. Coppola presents to non-Sicilian spectator the gloomy charm of ""my"" arid land. It's not only a mob-movie but also a film where all the elements are united among them: love, hatred, violence, friendship, betrayals, beauty. From the first scene with a great Salvatore Corsitto as Amerigo Bonasera, to the last scene the film keeps even the reclutantest spectator in a vice of emotions. The evocative images of Sicily and don Corleone's speeches (and not only...) have made of this movie maybe the most important work in the cinematographic sphere of all times,an icon. In conclusion of this my short review I can say only one thing: I BELIEVE IN AMERICA"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OllieSuave-007,7,7 September 2015,"The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cleanimageuk-32139,1,16 December 2015,"forced to sit through this шit so many times by idiots extolling its virtues. i wish it was never made. I'm sick of mafia films and this dross started it all, moody, violent, miserable, and as intelligent as football and drinking. too many idiots today actually believe they are mafia because they sell some pot, or bought a dog that they beat until it turned nasty. grow up and bin this film. wooden acting throughout this title has set the bar for gangster films, and of course gangsters are not known for flair or intelligence when a beating or a bullet appears to cure all ills. the film is not a pleasure to watch, nor could i be less interested in the story of this mediocre family squabble. OK so this is my least favourite genre but it set that level. i urge anyone who hates this film to review it here and bring it down in the rankings to a reasonable 1-3 because the 10/10 that thousands of morons gave this is unreal."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),filipemanuelneto,10,25 August 2015,"This film tells the trajectory of the Corleone family and its leader, the ""godfather"" Don Vito Corleone.

Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cariboolean,10,17 September 2006,"We all know what a wonderful movie this is. I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ibrahimbengaoua,10,12 August 2019,"This movie is best movie ever

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tutuandi,10,6 April 2006,"""The Godfather"" - it is incredible what resonance this name has.I am from a poor country where cinematography has just started to become part of our lives and i've always heard of this movie but never until now got to see it.Before viewing it i checked up on it to see what i should expect from it and i was mesmerized by all the comments and the praise it gets.I said to myself i shouldn't get my hopes high because I most probably will be disappointed after i see it.So i acquired it and i started viewing...after 20 minutes i had the ""one of those movies"" feeling.I like to ""live"" every movie i watch and entering in the Corleone family was the most incredible cinematic experience i have ever had.It is one of those movies that you just can't get your mind off even after 2 weeks since you've seen it...you keep reminding the characters and the sets and everything and you blend in creating scenarios in your head and feel the drama.The music is superb and every time i hear it i get chills up my spine and begin day dreaming.I am afraid to watch it again because maybe i will get the impression it's not that great but it will happen soon i think and i will relive it though first time you watch it you get the most shocking experience you can get.This is one of the few movies that will always remain in my head and that my soul will hang on to in the desperate wish that I will actually live for real an experience like this ( my intellect knows it will never happen but you just can't control these strong feelings)."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),a15haddad,10,15 February 2005,"The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a ""movie"" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen. "

I'm ok with sayings like ""Omg how you say this, it's the godfather"" so what? What makes the Godfather a Godfather. Couldn't have gotten this score just for acting and editing so ? It was very very nice but it was just a New York gangs story and it was like eh. What made you feel like giving this movie a 10. What? I'm begging you to make me feel like this. I watched this movie after seeing this score and it take my 3 hours. I'm happy for satisfying my curiosity but not for movie. The Shawshank Redemption or Seven or another movies were way better. I still don't know what was the point of the movie and why it have a score like 9,2. It is clearly 7,8-8,4 and just take it away from the list top 3. I don't want to watch 2 and 3 but o have to anymore. I'm sorry."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Alanjackd,4,14 June 2015,"Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Yoda-21,10,2 December 1998,"Let me start not with high praise, which is a regular sentence spoken on this movie. It is a motion-picture to discuss and yes there are elements in it that are extremely ambivalent. In the context of acting, directing and all the other formal aspects this is an exceptional achievement. I cannot think of too many others that can claim to have as polished dialogue and yet believable actors. But nevertheless the aspect of presenting a family-tragedy within a mafia-clan is at least to be consumed with your mind switched on. Coppola doesn't bother to present obvious critical points of view, but he presents the members of the Corleone-Clan as business-men. They react on their surroundings in the way it is necessary and to protect their family they don't bother to kill dozens of people. It is the contrast between the loving father and cold-blooded head of the clan, which attracts so many people to Brando's performance. He is so life-like on the one hand and yet manages to mute the  questionable traits of character that would paint Don Vito as a criminal. On the whole it can be said that this is still a movie which should polarize audiences, not least due to the growing influence of mafia like structures in many poor countries."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thomasclegg-63403,8,3 August 2022,This movie is so hyped up and i say this before watching part 2 it was incredibly dull. I felt very little emotion towards any character and overall i think it was a slow start and was not interesting until the last hour or so. Still a good movie but wouldnt watch again.

However, Godfather part II is close.... See it, and you want to be a gangster"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mcdcrusader07-1,10,20 October 2003,"The Godfather is not only the greatest movie ever made but can arguably be considered one of the best acting movies also.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuVall give mesmorizing performances in this classic about the inside of the crime organization known as the Corleone family. But it also tells the tale of Michael Corleone(played by Al Pacino) who, at the beginning, attempts to get away from the family business and move on his own.  But as the movies progresses, Michael becomes more and more attached to the family, and eventually becoming the successor to his father, Vito Corleone.  The Godfather is filled with a great storyline, beautiful acting, and a gruesome showing of the crime family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),renegadeviking-271-528568,9,1 November 2015,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece. ""The Godfather"" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately ""The Godfather"" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime gen"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pete_doyle7,10,6 April 2006,It is very difficult to talk about this film as a film. It is the beginning of in institution of gangSTAR films. Scarface has it going on but this is beautiful artisty combining actors that were Oscar winners and actors who went on to win Oscars! Al Pachino was incredible in depiction of a dark Amrerican come Sicillian... Marlon Brando was inspiring and I think made it very hard for Bob DeNero to measure up to. James Caan was very good and even the support characters were so well written and acted out it was brilliant! Along with this the music was also very good with the mix of Italian and American Swing. I loved it!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FilmOtaku,10,16 August 2003,"What can I say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said?  The film is a masterpiece of cinema, innovative and compelling.  I had the privilege of seeing it on the `big screen' recently at the local theater that shows classics and was as riveted as the first time I saw this film. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),The-Sarkologist,7,3 March 2012,"This was the biggest grossing film in 1972 when it was released and I am told that it follows closely to the Mario Puzo novel of the same name. The movie is followed by two sequels, which at first I believed were a part of the novel, but later realised that in fact they were separate. They seem to all meld together into one epic, though I will treat them all as separate movies, though I will refer back to the previous films occasionally."

I heard each movie is three hours long. Do I really want to watch a bunch of shoot'em ups? About five years ago I broke down and watched the first one in the saga. I was completely dumbfounded and amazed with this masterpiece. Very few movies fall under the word masterpiece and this is definitely one of them. I gave this a 10.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vincew9298,10,31 May 2002,"I was surprised looking at my voting history that I had not voted for this one before. Though not my number one it is one of the top ten ever made. The acting is outstanding. Young Pacino was at his very best. I don't want to start naming the actors, because all of them put in their best performance. Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented. The scene with the horse in the producers bed is gruesome, but the subjects are of that caliber. It is one of those movies that has to be seen at least once if for no other reason than because it truly is one of the best films ever made."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PWNYCNY,10,13 November 2005,"A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from ""enemies"" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed ""enemies""; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BonaFideBOSS,10,22 November 2017,"The Godfather is the best movie of all time because this movie got the most splendid crew. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo, the author of the book ""The Godfather"" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of movies, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Pacino's raspy pseudo- whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."

It was like this for every film until I watched The Godfather. "

Bringing a tragic story from reality to the magic world of the movies, so many people can enjoy it. Today seems the time has not past and it is very pleasant to enjoy amazing acting performances of each actor and still learn from each peace of scene. It will never past away and will stay as a classic, hope it can be around for all new generations of actors, directors and producers. Wish some day I can share tables and set with great actors like them, who have been inspiring and example in my work and professional life as an actor. Thank you all."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carsinincakali,10,19 October 2003,"with no doubt,the greatest movie of all time.loyalty,family relations,business,power,authority or enmity are all in the movie,but while wathcing they are all invisible,when it ends,you can feel them strongly. No producer can shot something better than it.It is an offer that human-being cannot refuse."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rpan,10,16 October 2005,"Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),charles-chaplin,10,10 August 2002,"A young director (Coppola) took by paramount with no big experience and a young protagonist (Al Pacino) with no big experience too, together they realized the greatest movie never made! Taken by the Mario Puzo's book, the Godfather isn't a really mafia story but, overall, is a story of a family, of a man who live for make it stronger and more powerful who finished to ruin it with his same hands... A story of cruel moments and a story of heart's tears too... Now, thirty years later it still be the greatest motion picture never done, with a screenplay with no equals, a cast strong, powerful and good-acting and with a love inside that isn't scary of the present and the future of the cinema.... All the trilogy is great, (overall the second godfather), almost 9 hours of intense emotions! I'm proud to give it 10! And now you can find it in dvd version too, with a special edition very special: godfather (1 disc), godfather II (2 disc) and godfather III (1 disc) with a extraordinary special contents too... where you can find all -and I mean ALL- about this movie we'll never forget for the rest of our life and life that we will live in the future!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bpatrascu,,27 October 2014,"The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jamie-rowlands1,10,19 July 2020,"The word masterpiece is bandied about a lot, freely and, in my opinion, too often used to label films that aren't worthy. It's true, however, that my idea of what a masterpiece is could well be different to that of another film fan - at the end of the day, it's all about the relationship you have to what you see on screen, it's all subjective, isn't it? The latest CGI-laden blockbuster or socially relevant indie may be hailed as a genius piece of work, but surely it can only sit comfortably marked that way once some time has passed, once posterity has spoken, so we can see it if stands up. It might be considered a masterpiece now, but what about in ten years time when the world's changed a little bit?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sh-82335,10,29 August 2020,"Well, When first time I watched The movie it was not so cool to me I mean not so well, I don't know my mind try to say go and watch that again well I watched again but this time 'not bad',Again third time my mind say go and watch again,Third time when I watched, It Was Masterpiece for AllTime!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tiddles2008,6,3 April 2023,"Don't get me wrong, there was nothing that I found bad about this movie, except the fight scene where Sonny clearly misses a punch, but apart from that there was nothing wrong with it. The soundtrack and acting are both amazing and should be an example for other movies. However, the plot just did not interest me, I also never understood why Sonny was killed but however it happened he deserved it. I honestly wish I hadn't spent 3 hours of my time watching this as I could have spent it doing something that I would have found much more interesting but I can not see how this is meant to be one of the best movies ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),isaac-goldberg,1,20 April 2012,"I honestly don't know what to say ... This has got to be the worst movie i've ever had the misfortune to watch and yet it's getting such good reviews. Why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me. Is almost everyone on IMDb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this? I found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it! My advice to anyone thinking of watching this - don't, it will only disappoint you. There is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging. Characters and events are boring to follow and personally I feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Kirpianuscus,,6 January 2018,"I saw it very late. the fame was one of basic motives. the theme - the second cause. for many friends, to see it was an experience. and it is an experience. without can say why. because , in a film about Mafia , for a special public, at first sigh, all is perfect. so perfect than, scene by scene, it becomes more than a masterpiece. great actors. special performances. memorable scenes. dialogues and situations and a cold feeling. a film about values. and near every day reality. and choices, errors and mistakes. who, after decades, remains fresh in memory. as an unique meet."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imshaniqbal,10,18 February 2021,Without any doubt there is nothing compare to this movie... I don't have enough words to say how good is this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saf_utd,10,22 February 1999,"No doubt about it, this a spectacular viewing experience. The acting along with the storyline makes this film a genuine masterpiece. The film covers a wide spectrum of genre keeping the viewer entertained throughout. TOP CLASS!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),blackmoonx-16538,10,19 December 2021,"Everyone in this movie has outstanding acting, especially Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, And John Cazale. Every time I watch this piece of art I forget that it's a movie due to the fact that the acting is so incredible."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),manwich,10,28 September 1999,"what can i say, this film is magnificent.  everything about it is flawless. i must admit, however, that i am partial to mafia pictures, but that doesn't matter.  i'm serious when i say it's a great film.  if you haven't seen it yet, please do so as soon as possible. thank you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jjosephanews,10,3 July 2022,"The storyline, screenplay and casting, couldnt have been any better. This in its simplicity is the metrics and the

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fishermensnetmaine,10,17 April 2021,This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eslam4330,10,28 August 2018,"10-10This movie is great, very good script, great casting, excellent and great acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is More than 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Phoenix-107,7,9 June 2001,"Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),orient_86,1,18 June 2005,"The movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style. It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rogierr,,31 July 2001,"Definitely not the greatest movie of all time, but the greatest crime movie it could be. Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tomback_br,9,12 September 2014,"The Godfather is the best film about the Mafia that has been done so today. He not only accurately portrays the disputes against rival families. The film also shows the whole family psychology that involves the family and relatives and friends who live with the family of Don Corleone. The wedding scene is one of the best scenes in the film, kept showing the Italian traditions, even though the USA The scenes of struggle and war between rival mobsters is also taking the breath. This movie is one of the few sequels that had the same quality of the first movie without losing quality. Not enough watch the first film we got to see three movies in a row ... hugs"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pdschandra,10,4 February 2019,"This is the textbook of how to do gangster movies. There are more than 1000 movies am sure inspired by this movie world over by this epic. Acting, Cinematography, Makeup, Action name any department and this movie excels. Have watched it for more than 100 times yet it never fails to amuse me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sarah-toce,10,29 June 2017,"Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of ""familia""...no wonder it stands the test of time. The performers were at the top of their games in this one. Maybe they should make a modern- day follow up. I mean, they are remaking everything else. Why not? Need a writer? Let me know! :)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),manuelwww,10,3 March 2019,"Cuenta una gran historia, cuenta con un buen elenco muy recomendada"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),epicbrowniez,10,5 October 2020,Watched it with family and I have yet to watch the sequels that I have been demanded to watch aha
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Davo-11,10,19 August 1999,"Without doubt, The Godfather is an excellent movie.  The acting, script, mood, music, cinematography and an indefinable haunting quality, all make for one of the finest movies ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aniskfr,10,13 February 2021,"The film has a strong script and has turned it into a masterpiece. Of course, Alpacino's role has given a pleasant taste to this film and made an attractive mafia film that all types should experience the pleasure of watching it once."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),francisterrero,10,28 June 2022,I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I wached many time.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),millerbn,6,5 December 2007,"Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure"" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Moviefan-24,1,14 February 1999,"I'm voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same. I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thespencerwelch,,27 January 2019,"Yeah its a good movie I guess, not the greatest of all time in my book but still vastly enjoyable by movie fans of all sorts, even fans of other types of movies"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),timmyminh,10,2 June 2020,"I have had a distinct pleasure to have watched this picture for the first time in a 35mm screen this year in a cinema in London that shows classic films. I refrained from watching it years ago in my teenage years because my ignorant past thought this film was overrated, but honestly, there is no possible word or expression that can describe how wrong I was. The cinematography of this picture is so unheard of and monumental that every frame of this picture looks like something that could be hung as a painting in a museum. The story brings with it elements of something that came out of a Shakespearean Tragedy. I have watched it 7 times or more in a short time, and it takes A LOT to make me watch a film for a second time, let alone 7. It is one of, if not my favorite film of all time. If human civilization were to go extinct, this should be one of the few pieces of art that must survive for future intelligent lifeforms to discover and marvel at."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abdur24rouf,9,15 August 2022,"Til today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karensolt-98,9,10 July 2022,"James Caan, who just passed away, is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shaerhaytham,9,8 May 2021,This film is amazing. I watched in my childhood and still.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jmeador-09026,10,28 July 2017,"I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chefjustin-78784,10,31 August 2022,"One of my favorite movies of all time, from the plot to the characters being played and being Italian it's one of those movies I can watch over and over again. Its a true masterpiece of film, its a movie that you can watch a dozen times and never get board of. A timeless masterpiece, initially I was like The Godfather okay this movie sounds good, once I started watching it and getting the knowledge of the movie it was like wow this has to be no.1 movie in the world it was that good. Again one of my favorite all time movies to ever watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dejancuric,10,9 January 2019,Probably the best movie ever made. This kind of movies you can watch over and over without getting bored
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),njdevils-75205,7,25 January 2023,"There's so many perfect executed scenes through The Godfather that it can be easy to underrate how nicely shaped the movie is, sometimes too overblown in that Coppola manner, but the transition between generations and with that capitalist periods is achieved with the precision."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grossincoming3,1,17 November 2014,"The story is disjointed, the acting is terrible (especially Corleone who sounds like he's got a stick up his ass), the film is too long, the wedding scene is almost perpetual, which makes me ask, how did this get a 9.2? I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eibon09,,13 February 2001,The Godfather(1972) helped resurrect a low budget genre known as the gangster genre and turned it into a major film genre for the next two decades.  Many people found a new way in speaking to each other by watching this film.  In fact many members of organized crime in the USA began to pattern themselves right after the characters in the film.  The gangster genre would become one of the most popular genres to come out of Hollywood since the end of Film Noir in 1958.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JRPGjr,10,25 January 2016,"Every character seems to be perfectly embedded, everyone has a specified reason to be in the plot and each one brings something substantial that makes us remember them. It is magnificent how the main characters show an ironic mix between honesty, respect, etc. and anger, betrayal and many other facets that makes us ask if they're good or bad people. Beyond a classification for the characters, you gonna love them as they are, and we can understand that there's more than just black and white. Definitely, a movie to watch, no matter how many years from his release, and no, I can't say that is a gangster movie, neither that is a Pacino's Movie, no no, It's more than that, The Godfather could be called for to many people like ""The Movie""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amribah,10,17 January 2019,This is with out a doubt one of the most beautifully made gangster films in history.the acting was simply amazing and mesmerizing .the script and directing were one of the most brilliant and iconic in the film industry! Francis Ford Coppola did a remarkable job.for me it is a 10 out of 10 and a must see.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nicorip22,10,28 August 2020,"Best movie ever, no matter when you read this, it will still be true. The adaptation of the book to the movie is also the best. Even if you don't like gangster movies you need to watch this classic, you are going to find really good but really good performances, i'm just going to highlight these 4 out of many more, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino (magnificent performances), Robert Duvall (Perfect), Talia Shire (extremely good). Please take the time to watch this movie, it's worth it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hjbishop-61203,10,31 January 2024,"As the title says, this is maybe an obvious statement and boring pick to call my favorite movie of all time, and maybe sometimes it isn't and I say it because it's an easy title that people know. That being said, if it is or if it isn't my favorite, it is still, in my opinion, a perfect film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MaximKozhevnikov,9,25 January 2019,One of the most amazing Movies in the history. Very close to the original source and masterfully done. I believe everyone should check out this masterpiece.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hmmndbryn-37901,10,31 January 2022,"This movie was one of the best movies ever made and it is the first movie made that cause me to be a film maker.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),david_richards,,31 July 2002,"This movie for good reason is regarded along with its sequel (which I think is a better film) as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. The mark it has left on society, especially the male psyche can never be underestimated or for that matter fully gauged. All actors turn in career defining performances and the overall ""feel"" of the movie is such that you feel for characters that in reality you would have every right to loathe. Not much can be written that has not already been said so just a quick reminder for that person out there who has not yet seen or heard of the Godfather to rent out an absolute classic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),daniilpiispanen,10,13 April 2016,"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johanleupen,10,20 July 2000,Coppola's classic interpretation of storytelling fits perfectly into this tale which many consider to be the greatest film ever made. The tragic life of michael corleone and his family against the background of the 40s new york underworld; a must-see in film-history. The scenes are extremely convincing and the atmosphere is appropriately dark and gloomy. The music accurately captures the epic scale and drama that the film is trying to get across.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jlspenc-35519,10,10 December 2022,"THE GODFATHER was a worldwide box office smash and cultural phenomenon ever since its release in 1972. The saga of Don Vito Corleone and his family -and his ""family""- has become so firmly entrenched in the public consciousness that it wouldn't be hyperbolic to compare it to Shakespeare. And like the Bard's works, THE GODFATHER will endure for many more decades, if not centuries. Between the vivid set pieces, quotable catchphrases, and Nino Rota's memorable score, THE GODFATHER has maybe two or three competitors for the title of ""greatest of all time""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carloscaballeroolpz,10,31 August 2020,"It's incredible how Coppola directed this film, every shot in this movie is well thought and incredibly executed.

When filming of it began three years later, the relatively unknown Francis Ford Coppola was hired to direct. Coppola had just made the box-office failure ""The Rain People"", so Paramount counted on him to be malleable and work for a fairly low salary."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marine-3,10,7 November 1998,I cannot add anymore superlatives to the previous comments from IMDb subscribers.  This movie is the greatest.  I read the book twice before seeing the film.  The first time for the pure enjoyment of the marvelous storyline & dialogue.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),The_Core,,4 March 2004,"Check out a copy of Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" from the library, or just buy the book (because you will want to anyway).  Lots of people have commented on things they liked or didn't like in the script, not realizing that they are taken straight from Puzo's masterpiece.  As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren't ""hooked"" by the second or third page I would be amazed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),liam-dwane,10,28 November 2023,"""The Godfather (1972) is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends time. Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, embodying power and vulnerability. Coppola's direction weaves an intricate narrative of crime, family, and power dynamics. The film's cinematography and score are timeless, creating an immersive experience. The Godfather is not just a mob saga; it's a profound exploration of morality, loyalty, and the American Dream. Every scene is a stroke of genius, making it a classic that continues to captivate audiences, leaving an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape.""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),swordfish-1,10,28 July 2002,"This is the best movie ever made, alongside with Godfather part II. I have no words to describe this, it's simply wonderful. I can't find even one little flaw. How could I? The directing by Francis Ford Coppola is the best ever done, the acting by Pacino, Brando, Duvall and the rest are astonishing. The cinematography and script couldn't be done better. This movie, if people will live in earth for many centuries, ain't never gonan be forgoten. This is something that even in the year 3002, parents must show to their children, so they'd understand what means a masterpiece. The only movie who came close to Godfather I and II is Schindler's List. So 30 years gonna and only one movie came close.  The best movie ever made. 101 stars out of 100."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PaulusLoZebra,10,11 July 2022,"This movie deserves either pages of analytics and insight or else the simplest of all reviews, and I opt for the latter.

Everyone should watch this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Turfseer,7,31 October 2023,"While some argue that ""The Godfather"" glorifies violence, I beg to differ. Director Francis Ford Coppola seems to use violence to expose his characters' collective guilt and sacrilege. Their hypocritical displays of piety culminate in the Baptism scene, cleverly juxtaposed with a mob hit, shedding light on the family's duplicity. Even the women in the story play their part in this charade, enabling the men's heinous crimes."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ranbnzz,10,7 February 2019,"It feels more like a documentary than a movie, a documentary on family history. This movie super-passed the original novel, it reminds me of Márquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bastiaannova,9,12 May 2021,"The movie is a masterpiece, even in 2021 it still is great. It's the best movie of it's kind that I've ever watched."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Vowels-Branding-Agency,10,29 March 2023,"The Godfather is an epic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences even today, almost 50 years after its release. The film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic masterpiece that combines a gripping story with stunning performances, beautiful cinematography, and an iconic score."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Budd-5,10,15 September 1999,"We won't know until about twenty years from now whether the films we watch in the nineties are classics. Personally I think only three can justify such a title so far - Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption and La Vita e Bella. Three movies without anything missing. Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jschroaders,10,21 August 2018,"Wow, Absolutely amazing film. A wonderful cast of actors."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),leslierajan,7,27 September 2021,"I love that this scene establishes the entire theme of the films--which is family and relationships. The scene is basically ""this movie is about the mafia, but it's not John Wick and this is not about murder. And we are not hitmen. We are people who value our relationships"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),billpappas-1,3,25 November 2010,I saw Godfather when it came out. I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aramdcarey,10,25 February 2022,"A legendary film, great performance and storytelling. Marlon Brando acts like a genuine mafia boss that walked on set. Music score really makes the emotions of the film better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vitorle99,10,12 February 2019,"I am 19 years old, but I've been seeing and listening about this movie my whole life, so I finally sat and watched it.
And it is astonishing by the fact, that what turns the movie to be so good is, the most common, usual, old conversations (knowing what that conversation will lead to). I enjoy Mafia movies since day one, so watching this masterpiece was like playing Mafia games. The Godfather has on hands an incredible cast.
I do believe Al Pacino was born to portray mobsters in Mafia movies, and you clearly see how good he is, since the Dinosaurs age. (old times if you didn't understand what supposed to be a ""joke"")."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),coffeedood,10,16 March 2007,The Godfather is the first and arguably the greatest of The Godfather trilogy with excellent acting on all parts most especially that of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The films excellent portrayal of Mafia's during the 40's and the transfer of power between Vito and Micheal which is eventually well summed up in part II (Which if you haven't seen I would highly recommend it.) While The film may not have all the action and cool tones of Goodfella's (which I very much so enjoyed) The godfather is clearly a better film with a much more fascinating plot and classic moments. The Godfather is a film where I would make no changes whatsoever weather it be acting or story the film is essentially perfect. I would recommend this film to anyone regardless of their taste in film.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Apology7,10,3 October 1999,"The Godfather is the best movie of all time. It was made so great, with great plot, with a lot of suspense, and great acting. This movie in my opinion has had the best cast ever-- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. If you haven't watched this yet, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse! WATCH IT!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),educallejero,10,28 August 2018,"I won't say much about this. This is perfect at every level.
The story, epic.
The acting and dialogue, memorables.
The pace, irreproachable.
The editing, precise.
The score, iconic.
Francis Lord Coppola creating the definitive master piece. The master piece of master pieces, executing everything as perfectly as it ever something was excecuted."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imdbmoviereview,2,12 February 2006,"This movie was probably relevant in the 70s and may have been a benchmark at the time it was made. Watching it in 2006, I can see how it added to the movie landscape and that effect that it had on subsequent film making."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hani-beydoun,10,4 June 2016,"One of the best classics of all time, good story, with incredible acting. Even though the movie was three hours long, it's hard not finish it.The sequence of the movie flows so good in a way, the audience are always wondering what's going to happen next. Very enjoyable, even for people who don't like Mafia movies in general, because the movie discusses many things in life like family, greed, loyalty and relationships."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moviedude1,9,15 July 2003,"The Corleone family saga begins with Brando granting (or refusing) the requests of his friends, family, and neighbors during his daughter's wedding.  That's just the beginning of the epic saga that put the name Puzo on the map."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CristoNobel-LLP-Management,7,1 January 2023,A pretty good underworlds drama... Presenting us with a very good picture of the inside world of the Italian mafia and their activities in Italy (Sicily) and the USA (New York and various other places).
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),atari-survey,2,11 July 2004,"This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can't even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jdenha20,10,6 January 2007,"I read some of the other reviews that people posted and wanted to say it was quite possibly the greatest movie ever! For those who voted it badly, I can see why..partially. The first time I saw it for some reason, I couldn't get into it. I had to stop it and continue watching it another day. It seemed to bore me. That is until they whacked off a few of the best characters in the movie. I swear I could hardly recover from those blows. When they Killed Sonny I couldn't believe it!!! He was my favorite actor in the movie as with Marlon Brando! At least the movie did it so tastefully that even in the manner of their deaths, I was shocked by the delievery of them. Although I must say they should have put more details in with Sonny's death, The effects weren't that great plus I'm beginning to think he is like tony Montana because he gets rittled with at least 4 tommygun rounds and still manages to get out of the car and goes down after 10 rounds; remarkable! If I were him I would have at least floored it!!!! NOT GET OUT OF THE CAR!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),felixmartinsson,9,2 August 2017,"What matters is family, you pick a side and you stay on that side, if you switch side, you're the enemy and will forever be the enemy until you're dead. You look out for your family, and make sure everyone is okay. You don't discuss business at the table when having dinner. Power and Money - ""Business"" comes second! It's the Corleone family against Barzini and Tattaglia and 3 other mob leaders. The Corleone family is the biggest most powerful mafia family in New York, and the family you turn to if you need a problem to disappear. A lot of blood is spilled and Don Vito Corleone also known as the Godfather (Brandon Marlon) is almost killed in a shooting by another gang. Mike and Sonny are his sons. Sonny is his right hand at first until one day when he gets killed by a gang after going after his sisters boyfriend for assaulting her. Then Mike steps in and takes over, Don Vito gets older and more cripple and soon he dies too, that's when Mike (Al Pacino) becomes the new Godfather, and kills the 5 mafia leaders, to take control over New York, and eliminate all potential threats.

A story in which there is excitement, advice, pride and honor."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),reiya-32720,10,27 November 2023,"After a very long time feeling bored of series and boring movies I was scrolling through a list of top 100 films I came across Godfather as amongst the top , but as an Indian with less interest in foreign films I was alone one day and started watching on an evening , I don't remember when it finished, I just made coffee and started again and by the night time I was stunned by such a beautiful film i saw , it was like a stunning display of everything actors acting like real life dons, Marlin Brando wooooh just out of the world, Cinematography seen like never before , in fact cinematic experience was as some magician putting his best paintings, the last scene depicting Baptisation and how the other things happened in the background shows true mettle of the director."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sanou_san,10,9 September 2009,"Being a youth (but I would safely consider myself now as an adult), I never get into much witnessing adult stories. I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the ""Godfather"". I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vebiwang,9,24 June 2018,At first i tough this movie will be a boring one. but after watching it ... it give me a gosebump... the storyline so good .. it makes me know how cruel the world back then

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sumavulo,10,18 February 2022,This is a very good film. Just wanted to watch something and this film popped out nowhere. Gonna watch the other 2 film when iam free lol. Maybe iam left behind not knowing this film.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),melo4777,10,23 January 2019,"I had always thought this movie was overrated before I had watched it, it truly deserves its rating.
I usually get bored when watching dialogue scenes in movies but I didn't even flinch watching this masterpiece, even gave me goosebumps.
The music is also playing an important role in making this movie perfect."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Alan_Arsoyev,10,18 September 2014,"Phenomenal! One of the best movies ever made. Great acting! music, screenplay! Great directing. I can't express my feelings with just words. One of Hollywood's greatest films. It may take a many viewings to fully comprehend the film. I wasn't ready for what this movie had in store for me. This movie will pull you in each time you watch it. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story is great, the characters are very carefully chosen. Al Pacino's performance is very good.. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's best films ever. A piece of art which will live in the hearts of many, This film is a brilliant mob movie, that everyone should watch. Everyone I know loves this film. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give give great performances in their finest movie ever. The amount of work put in The Godfather is just amazing! I can feel each character's emotion in this movie. I give it 10 out of 10"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bostonct,10,25 February 2022,"Strongly recommend seeing on the big screen again. The little nuances, sounds and the subtleties that come out on the big screen and the continuity just reminds you just how great this movie is. Or better yet, just how much you were missing watching this on a DVD or worse, TV."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),holt21,10,13 February 2013,"""The Godfather"" is an American Crime film, which made its debut into theaters on March 24, 1972. The film was based on the original penned by Mario Puzo, with the same title. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film was centralized around the lives of an elite mob family in New York. Regarded as a classic, The Godfather has been an iconic American film, having been considered one of the greatest features in American films. It is a film that is multifaceted having evidence of several emerging underlying themes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stormhawk2021,10,19 June 2017,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aliameern,7,30 October 2021,"A musician lives with his wife in a small house in Dallas, Texas. They are looking for a new home and planning their move. She tells him that before she moves away from a place, she likes to hide a note for herself there, in case she ever returns. They occasionally hear strange noises in the house; one night they hear a loud bang in their living room, which contains a piano that came with the house. They cannot find the source of the noise."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chrisb69-2,1,17 June 2000,"After hearing about this legendary film I decided it was about time I watched it....after about an hour I really wished I hadn't wasted the money renting it...after the movie finished I was bored.  The film was nothing like I had expected and I don't know how it possibly made it as big as it has.  It was quite well cast I love Diane Keaton but she's better in Woody Allen's comedy's than in this derivitive movie.  You want a good gangster movie...watch Goodfella's...it actually has a good story, entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era.  I'm not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz Marlon Brando ain't even in them so their ain't much point! I think I'll go watch Marlon Brando's greatest performance...Guy's N Doll's."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Saqroot,8,9 February 2019,"Have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ThanasisProtatos,10,12 February 2018,"Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fcjsonl,10,10 February 2019,"One of the most enjoyable movies ever, with deep an interesting charachters and realistic storylines. Quite toned down, no over the top action, but the gradual transformation of Michael into a mafia boss, despite his intent not to become one. An important scence in the beginning, from the wedding, has come to symbolize the type of relationship-based culture for me. Bonasera has been avioding the mob for a long time, but now that his daugther was assaulted, he needs their help. He comes and asks for help, offering money. The Godfather refuses - he does not want money, we wants respect. Debt precedes money as a social institution, according to Graeber. The original way of functioning in an economy was local and very trust-based. These types of institutions, together with a well-developed honor codex are very prevalent in the mafia culture. The gracious, private, inconspicuous nature of the mafia, and their honor of their word are central to their role in society."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alituncheri,8,25 February 2023,"People around me and IMDB ratings were saying that this movie is one of the best Hollywood movies in history. Despite all the things I've heard, I put off watching the movie for years. I watched hundreds of crime movies and TV series until I watched this movie. I finally watched the movie 50 years after its making. And I can say that the movie is a bit old for today. Because we have watched many productions like this and we are used to many of the details in the movie from different movies and TV series. Of course, this is not the fault of this film, but all that we are familiar with makes the film simple for today's cinema. I don't know how accurate it is to compare the movie with today's movies and evaluate it accordingly. But as today's audience, I can say that the film does not meet some demands. Does that make the movie a bad movie? No. But it's just old."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),klabys,10,31 October 2016,"Marlon Brando's old flame that has glowed for years, and flickered along a trail bumpy with mediocre pictures, shines higher and brighter than ever. The old irresistible magic is revived in Paramount's ""The Godfather"" in his intuitive grasp of Mario Puzo's Don Corleone, a living symbol of the poetic translation of his name, the lionhearted."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fvckitshakespeare,10,17 January 2019,"This movie is a good one and its on the must-watch list, seriously, you must watch this :D"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),statxri,10,10 January 2016,"This movie is excellent! Probably the best I've ever seen the props are very good minding the year it was released and the acting is out of this world. I've read the book before and after watching the movie and I tell you the second time was much better! It was like the pictures the book tried to create came out alive as I've seen the in the movie and it was really cool. They did put a lot of effort to this movie and it does pay off, as the scenery and the costumes and everything is so detailed. Of course the atmosphere of the movie is marvelous and really travels you back to the 40s spot on! You should totally see this movie, or better watch the whole trilogy. It is must!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DaveTrevinoSoundDesign,9,6 March 2014,"progression of the movie follows the development of the following linear, logical sequenced story lines – Don Corleone is shot; Michael seeks retaliation by shooting Sollozzo and McClusky; The mafia family wars begin with a parallel story of Michael taking refuge in Italy; Don Corleone holds a peace summit between the families; Michael returns to America and becomes the new family Don upon his father's death. This is a standard ""cause and effect"" progression with each scene logically leading to the next having characters with differing goals clashing, and obtaining help from other characters to resolve conflicts and meet their ultimate goals. As a result, the characters' individual actions as well as group interaction help move the movie along."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stani_cv,7,25 February 2024,"And i have to say the book is so captivating and gives so many additional layers to the characters presented in the movie. ""The Godfather"" is very well directed and acted film. Also, almost all the scenes are very truthful to the source material. No wonder the movie is ""Mario Puzo's The Godfather"". From a classical movie perspective there's a lot to appreciate. I think they tried to be as authentic as possible casting Italian actors, but some were pretty weak in their performance. Also some didn't fit the character very well - I really can't accept Robert Duval as Tom Hagen. The ending of the movie also felt so much more rushed. With the pace it was all going I thought the ending of the book was going to be unfolder in the second movie, but that wasn't the case. Suddenly everything just happened quickly and that was it. I don't know, but I'm getting regrets that I didn't see the movie first. Honestly, Mario Puzo set the bar pretty high."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),guru-12,10,18 September 1999,"A very learned friend of mine once said that this was the closest film would ever come to the great operas of European legacy.  I'm not inclined to disagree.  This was the finest piece of celluloid I've ever encountered, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It was tense, beautifully shot, unbelievably acted (Brando is a genius.  That's it.), and had everything else going for it that could possibly be good about a film.  Oh my."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stardomslot,10,29 November 2023,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that transcends time and genre. Released in 1972, this film adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is a tour de force in storytelling, character development, and cinematography. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone are performances etched into the annals of film history, while the film's exploration of power, loyalty, and the complex dynamics of a crime family continues to captivate audiences across generations. Clocking in at nearly three hours, ""The Godfather"" is a meticulously crafted epic that unfolds with precision, drawing viewers into the Corleone family's world and its intricate power struggles within the organized crime underworld."

The storyline, the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the cinematografie. It's all really good. It is a classic movie I believe everyone should see at least one time in their life. Yes the sit is kinda long, but the time flies by so fast you won't even notice it. And after 3 hours, you still want more."

After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alhrbijawad,10,13 February 2021,For me it is the greatest work of cinema ever made i love al Pacino
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),noozheen,7,26 August 2022,I think if you want to learn story board of drama movie you must see this film.and break down the shots - its awesome movie for watching - the lighting is weak.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),profpatsch,4,17 October 2009,"OK, I REALLY don't get it. I always thought: ""Oh well, the Godfather, masterpiece, everyone has to watch it at least once in their live, let's see it then (someday)"". Then today I finally decided myself to watch it and I was shocked about it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mmd_msdf,10,28 June 2022,"The best movie in the history of cinema
There really is no more unique than this movie in my opinion
I have little to say
I still enjoy watching this movie and learning something from it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brianschlesinger,10,11 August 2022,"This one is the classic family movie. They just happen to be murderers and gangsters and businessmen. This is the movie that taught all non-gangsters how that world really is and what it is like to be involved with the family. Some of the best crew was put together, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton to name a few and it was all brilliantly directed by Francis Ford Coppola."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ebiros2,9,24 January 2006,"This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of ""fluff"" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly ""angry"" or ""troubled"" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davmkrt,10,8 July 2023,The unique. The only one . The greatest Godfather.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nozzk,10,2 April 2000,"the Godfather is one of the best films you will ever see. This is an entralling tail of an aging mobster who must choose from his sons a successor to his position. Having only recently seen the film for the first time, and then reading Mario Puzo book, you see how well most characters were transferred to the screen. Sonny, Michael, Freddy, Clemenza, Tom, Tessio, Johnny and Kay to name but a few were all well acted and true to the book (Though Johnny Fontaine's part was cut down severely). The only exceptions were the Don himself (Pure Marlon Brando, De Niro did a much better job of playing Vito Corleone in Godfather II) and Luca Brasi, who was hardly the scary underground hitman of the book."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BarristerMisu,10,12 April 2021,Because of the title of this movies I watched this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),H0kv5,10,25 May 2023,"I could use the word of our Lord and personal savior but that in reality would only Sully his preciousness, and if i use the name of the creator then it would mean i have no respect for him, when it came down to earth the messing up of humans and power can only boil down to the chosen ones, they can deny it all they want but leaving everything up to time only makes it harder stronger and when the dust finally settles the view becomes clear and then acceptance is paramount, judging by the way it all started no amount of action can rival the potency of the one called the godfather that's the highest ranking human in the world, not to make it personal but that's something to keep an eye out for, in my regards don't toy with the godfather."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rudgeno1-1,1,27 February 2005,"This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hidhircloud,10,13 January 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time. The film tells the story of the Corleone crime family, and the struggles they face in maintaining power and loyalty within their ranks. The themes of family, power, and betrayal are woven seamlessly into the plot, creating a truly engaging and emotionally resonant experience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ItsAlexHype,10,21 February 2021,"One of the best films ever, The Godfather is such a great gangster drama and representation of cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mdelbertcma,10,26 October 2012,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is an exciting thrill ride into the 1940's mob lifestyle. It follows a character theme with additional focus on the plot. Though all five theme elements are present, this story is told with a vision into the lives of a mob family and therefore takes on the character theme. Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brandon is the head of one of New York's five mob families. He lives with the old world style and the Italian tradition that family and business issues should never mingle. At his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding it is custom of the Godfather to take requests. This sets the scene for the ties that bind this family to power. Don Vito has three sons,Santino played by James Caan, Fredo played by John Cazale, and Michael played by Al Pacino. He has one adopted son Tom (Robert Duvall) which is his personal attorney and consilere(adviser). Each of these boys with the exception of Michael is learning the family business. Michael returns home from the military unsuspecting that he will take his role in the business after his father is gunned down by drug lord Virgil Sollozzo. In return for protection and political contacts Sollozzo offers the Godfather a reasonably large profit, but despite the advice of his boys he continues with his old world ways and denies the opportunity. Sollozzo, seeing that the next in line to run the family (Santino) found this to be a lucrative deal then orders the hit on Don Vito. This sparks the mob war of all the five families and the rise of the future Don."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),andreaspanu,9,29 September 2006,"I honestly can't understand those who voted one star for this movie: probably they're trying to counter-balance the great number of 9 and 10 given by many viewers. This movie is complete, with very good actors, enchanting music and a nice plot. The behavior of the characters and their way of speaking is accurate, the atmosphere of the scenes set in Sicily is real and so is the portrait of a ""famiglia"" with that kind of activities. This movie is the ""standard"" for all the following movies about mafia and it created a collective imaginary about this subject like no other movie. Some parts may be a bit long, but if you start enjoying the moves, the glares and the dialogues of the characters you will like them just like the action parts. I don't know if this movie deserves to be #1 of all times but surely it's the best movie of the genre I've ever seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EduardoRosa,9,22 January 2016,"It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and not get tired of seeing the movie repeatedly. The masterpiece of film history. Higher than the first by recreating childhood Vito and his subsequent rise in the world of the mafia, played by Robert de Niro, action that would be worth an Oscar masterful, and that would lead to stardom, being considered today one of the best actors of all time, but the best. Al Pacino makes the best performance in the history of cinema. A display of how to act it would enshrine in the film world as one of the best players in history, with a solid film career available to very few. Her performance is masterful, magnificent, powerful as it was in the first, but this far exceeds the. That look like ice shivers when you see it and freezes your blood, penetrates like you two knives stabbing you, this passivity when it is in front of his wife is historical, one of the best images from the history of cinema; also master the kiss with which condemns his brother Fredo, just spectacular ..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dhoomysul,10,29 June 2022,I don't know why i didn't see The Godfather till now but after watching the offer it was time for me to watch this masterpiece. And i was glad I watched it for the first time after I finished the offer. All i can say is this is truly one of the best movies out there.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Uriah43,10,9 March 2020,"Based on the best-selling novel by the same name, this film begins in 1945 at a large party hosted by the head of the most powerful organized crime family in the United States ""Don Vito Corleone"" (Marlon Brando) to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter ""Connie Corleone"" (Talia Shire). As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It's also during this time that his youngest son ""Michael Corleone"" (Al Pacino) arrives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers ""Sonny Corleone"" (James Caan), ""Fredo Corleone"" (John Cazale) and his adopted brother ""Tom Hagen"" (Robert Duvall), Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision. Unfortunately, things don't go quite as planned and-like it or not-Michael is soon thrust into the situation due to matters outside of his control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding film which combined great acting with a very deep and intricate plot. And to further illustrate its significance it was honored the following year with three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards as well. In short, this is an excellent movie I strongly recommend it to all viewers looking for a film of this sort."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),c-hudson1,10,2 October 2014,"Godfather is a groundbreaking and truly original piece of legendary film. With a cast of Oscar winners and awesome script, this film feels like you have been implanted into the scene of a real environment. Life like acting with emotive vibrations, grips you from the offset, with a compelling story that seems to get more intense and exciting as the film rolls on. This film will never get old and I have the lost the count how many times I have watched the famous trilogy. Having owned this on Video, DVD and now Bluray, I can honestly say this will be in my collection for all time. True classic. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Fox in Socks,6,17 June 2002,"Even quite tense at times - that restaurant scene had my heart pounding, as did the hospital scene. But it is overhyped. Okay, scene composition and direction are top notch, yadda yadda, acting is phenomenal, but you can't watch it without thinking ""everyone says this is the greatest film of all time"". Well maybe it is for some, but the film suffers from high expectations as a consequence. Not that you, gentle reader, are interested, but I didn't rate it as highly as Apocalypse Now, Seven Samurai or even Star Wars, but it deserves a respectable 8/10 and if you haven't seen it, its worth 3 hours of your time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Roxy100,1,8 December 2014,"I watched the DVD recently because everyone seems to be hyped about this 'greatest movie on earth'!! Well, I wouldn't waste your valuable time any further writing a lot here after wasting my good 3 hours watching so called God Father. I nearly died of boredom. Simply, this is one of the most boring, longest movies I have ever watched. And it is horrible! Is it a great story? No. Is it a great movie? NOT AT ALL!! It is just a welded work of so many boring, long celluloid pieces together. There is no stature, depth, matter or even an exciting plot. After all, Brando is a good actor but not that great in this one for sure. And I am still at a loss to understand why people give this rut 9.2!! It would of course be totally right just without the 9!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Balboa627,10,9 December 2007,"The perfect movie. Wish they could make some more like this! The perfection achieved in story, the drama and tension and stakes and the unbelievable performances by the entire cast, from top to bottom, add up to a theatrical experience, journey really, that achieves the potential we all hope for when we go to the movies. Amazing work that more than stands the test of time. I wonder if film producers and studios and directors today might take a cue from the film making process that was in place for this film. The freedom that Coppola had to put together his creative team, including many unknown actors in lead roles, even Brando at the time was considered un-hirable - was so critical to the success of the film. And yet today studios and producers think filling up their movies with ""names"" is the key to good film making, or film selling rather. But isn't film selling predicated upon having a good film to sell? So why not let the filmmakers fulfill their vision with the right characters, not the right names. We just need look back to films like this to see that part of what made them so great was the ability to fill them with actors that we could really believe were the characters they were playing. Not movie stars dressing up to sell tickets. It's just not the same out there anymore."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),V-Frye,10,20 July 2018,"Of course, a million movies imitate all the superficial aspects, the mafia stuff that's become cliche, but they don't really try to make a movie like THE GODFATHER. Maybe they're just being realistic - not many people could pull off a movie that good. But still. Let's see some striving, people. True greatness has been proven possible. You'll never get it unless you try."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jb-448,10,7 September 2007,"The very best film of the seventies. The very best film of the 20th Centuatry, the very best film of all time. Most definitely. While it's not my favourite film, (Pulp Fiction is the No. 1) It's in my opinion the best. The story is brilliant. The scenes whether the baptism scene or Sonnys death scene or that horribly grisly scene which involves one man one bed and a certain part of a horse, are memorable. The acting is superb. Marlon Brando's best even when he'd already played Terry Malloy and Stanly Kowloski (Two of the very best performances ever). Al Pacino's, despite what many Scarface fans might say, best performance he is great in Part One yet he is chillingly stupendous in Part 2. The list goes on. James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazele all shine in their own great light. Many people talk about this film but they can never sum it up right. Neither can I. It may not be the most realistic Mob film, Goodfellas would be the most in my opinion, it portrays the Italian mob so well, if anybody told me it was much different i would eat my hat. The funny thing about this is no matter how brilliant this film is the book is much better. If you haven't read or seen this film you haven't lived. Period..."

With stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacio, Robert Duvall it shows you the quality of the movie at the first minutes of it even without even seeing the movie. I have seen ""The Godfather"" 10 to 12 times so far and i don't regret it a bit. Nobody does. If you haven't seen the movie yet(which is rare and unfortunate) you should.

Despite the length of the movie, I was thoroughly engaged throughout. When a movie has you routing for the bad guys, it demonstrates the impact of an excellent story well executed. The film is so much more than just a gangster movie. It addresses politics, family values, crime and the social norms of the time. I know that I will watch this many more times as well as the Godfather films which follow. Fast paced, excellent acting, great music all combine to make this a must see."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brightube,9,21 July 2018,One of the greatest films of all time. MUST Watch for all generations.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pooch-8,,16 March 1999,"The Godfather is as beautifully directed, photographed, designed, edited, scored, and performed as any American film -- it is a masterpiece in the broadest sense; a colossal accomplishment for Francis Ford Coppola in the decade he virtually owned as a popular and artistic filmmaker.  Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny's fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on.  Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall.  Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn't imagine the film without them.  The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bt698nhj,6,23 November 2016,"I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb.

It is truly incredible that the atmosphere of being able to live in the film, which cannot be made now despite the year it was made, was created in those years. You can learn a lot about life from this movie. If we need to examine the soundtrack of the movie, all the sound arguments in the movie, including the effects, are handled properly. I had goosebumps the first time I heard the music that reminded me of this movie when heard.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moonspinner55,7,18 March 2006,"Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990. *** from ****"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),suleiman-96114,10,16 January 2016,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),as-88306,10,17 January 2019,"It absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),minister_of_silly_walks,10,3 September 2020,"To put it short, ""The Godfather"" is a timeless masterpiece. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get to. It has an amazing script which is directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The cast is Hollywood royalty from top to bottom and everyone plays their part to perfection. Of course, the stars of the film are Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. Both of the actors give career defining performances portraying arguably two of the most famous characters to be ever put on film. The film is filled to the brim with unforgettable scenes and quotes all of which work seamlessly together in crafting a highly re-watchable masterpiece of cinema that will equally satisfy the casual moviegoer as well as the most harden film critics."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LeonZerkalo,10,7 May 2024,"""The Godfather"" is a timeless masterpiece that captivates audiences with its intense storytelling, unforgettable characters, and iconic performances. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film dives deep into the intricate world of organized crime, focusing on the powerful Corleone family. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is legendary, bringing a complex mix of authority and vulnerability to the screen. The film's narrative, exploring themes of loyalty, family, and power, is both compelling and thought-provoking. The cinematography and score are outstanding, creating a rich and immersive atmosphere that draws viewers into the mafia underworld. ""The Godfather"" stands as a cinematic triumph, setting a high standard for storytelling and character development. Its influence on popular culture and the gangster genre is undeniable, making it a must-watch for any film enthusiast."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),legend-25,10,26 August 1999,"Without the Godfather cinema is missing its backbone.  Often heralded as the greatest movie in history, I would not dare disagree.  This is the only flawless material this world has ever made.  The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it.  The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it.  The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor.  Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down.  It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...)  Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman).  James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both.  The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture.  This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter.  I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home).  No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema.  Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows such insight and power in leading a family I wouldn't mind letting him run America as President.  I own three copies of this movie one for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I recommend this movie for anyone who can breathe.  rating/10.  PS contact me for any more recommendations on movies, they don't call me the ""tree of knowledge"" for nothing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacals-montfy,9,28 December 2020,"The Godfather follows Vito Corleone, the titular character, sinisterly played by Marlon Brando, as he tries to develop his son, Michael (a young and excellent Al Pacino) to become the 'Don' of the Corleone family, albeit in a violent and dangerous, Mafia dominating New York."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salmanqureshi1,,6 March 2023,"My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience. A very good movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bondo20,7,2 February 2002,"The Godfather series stands as the best in the mob dramas, but"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BigWhiskers,1,18 December 2006,"A 9.1 on IMDb? cat-scans please .I've never seen a worse depiction of Italians in my life. More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Leogetz100,10,18 May 2016,"The Godfather is an absolute ""Classic"". Both Al Pacino and Robert DeNero killed their roles. It's not often we get a movie with such in-depth detail as to why things happened the way they did. Politically correct in every ""bad"" way. I was very young when i first seen this movie and really didn't grasp the exact concept. Now, as an adult, it all makes sense. If anyone reading this has never seen this movie, I recommend you watch it and the others as well. It might even touch home with most that grew up in these neighborhoods and countries during the date allocated within the film. Film makers and anyone acting should make it an occupation to watch this film. Exciting, passionate, dramatic. These are the words I use to best describe my experience with watching this movie. It has also sparked my interest in making my own films. The action and originality of the film makes me want to create a movie just like this one in modern day times. Thank you Godfather, for you have given me much needed inspiration."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Marvalbeatz,10,6 November 2023,"Despite its nearly three-hour runtime, there's no need to fret about the duration. The movie effortlessly captures your attention, making time seem to fly by."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Timbo_Watching,9,25 March 2020,"This film was way ahead of it's time, even to this day it's still the pinnacle of a masterpiece. Every single element of this is amazing. The cast, the acting, the writing, the settings, the directing... despite it being quite a long film, whereas I am known to be distracted more easily the longer a film is; this film made me hooked on it until the very last second. I just absolutely love the story too, such a well crafted Italian gangster film all about ""la familia"".. if you haven't seen this film yet what are you doing?? Watch it right now!!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),valentyn1992-78-546712,10,19 September 2014,"The movie is more than worth watching, it is one of the classic movies of the American cinematography. Al Pacino is as always great. And the story, the atmosphere and the spirit of Italian-American neighborhoods, of ""old school"" mafia, ""La Cosa Nostra"", was transferred amazingly great. You shall see lots of interesting stuff about Italian Mafia traditions, about their Code, that used to value back in the days. In my humble opinion, the second part (The Godfather II) is not as good as this one, and you should definitely see at least this. I remember I first heard of this movie from my grandfather. And if he advised the movie, it meant that it's good indeed. This one was not an exception."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sayandutta-01381,10,18 September 2021,Coppola and Maria Puzo take you on a journey through the shadiness of the mafia world where we witness the greatest character arcs ever. The cinematography and camera placement of this movie are what makes it different from conventional gangster films.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Underius_7,9,8 October 2022,"The great example of how to execute a scene Synopsis Michael arrives to visit his father at the hospital and realizes that no one protects him and he knows that he is too vulnerable. It is a very difficult situation but Enzo arrives and says that he can count on his help and Michael tells him that he is waiting outside the hospital (at the door) Enzo obeys He throws the flowers away, puts his hands in his pockets and lifts her collar. (remember that Enzo and Michael are not used to dealing with this type of problem, they are not murderers, they are just 2 people outside a hospital)After that action, a car is seen arriving, but seeing precisely 2 guys standing outside, they prefer not to take risks and do not go in to attack. They realize? With just an action as simple as being outside a hospital, they stopped the possible murder of Vito Corleone And it is not unlikely at all, on the contrary, it is very logical that they would not want to enter just by seeing them there since they deduced that there would be more than them. It is impressive how they manage to narrate this whole situation and solve it in a simple but logical way If you think about it, this whole scene contains the 4 levels of conflict And it is essential since Michael for the first time acts as a corleone With this you realize that no, it's godfather it's not like any movie it's ART. The entire film is narrated by someone who knew exactly what to tell and how to do it, and this can be easily seen by how a simple action of standing outside a door has everything to do with it. A plot weight behind. This doesn't need great special effects or illogical stuff, this had a great writer, director and acting. Without a doubt, no one can deny that The Godfather is a masterpiece."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elifyagmurduran-53875,1,13 March 2023,This movie is about boring and miserable people making others miserable in a boring way. I do not get why it is so highly praised. Sure great performances from every single actor and actress - but the story is just. So. Uninteresting.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ranamajidkhann,10,11 March 2022,What a great movie of all times according to me. It's simply a masterpiece. Loved every bit of it. Great performances by marlon brando and al pacino. It was soo real.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),essjayar,10,2 April 2000,"I eventually saw this film as it is widely regarded as one of the best ever made. The hype and the 10/10 ratings ARE true. This is excellent! I saw Godfather 2 first as it deals with the young Vito in part so comes (chronologically) first in the series but part 1 is the best. From Marlon Brandos oscar-winning performance to Al Pacino (the true star) this film is practically perfect. Vitos demise, Michaels rise, the downfall and eventual success of the Corleone family - all perfectly plotted. Any film that can make you care for gangsters has to be doing something right. There are some dubious moral issues, but this is a movie - you watch it to be entertained. Who can forget the horses head scene, Sonnys assassination, even the oft-repeated quotes such as `I`m gonna make him an offer he can`t refuse`... If you haven`t seen this film then watch it. I only wish I had seen this film earlier."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),georgepeterson-97822,10,29 June 2016,"I'll start off by saying, as the title says that this is most certainly one of the best movies I ever watched. The movie is fun to watch, what's most important and it's not just for certain parts of the movie, but the whole movie all the way through from the beginning to the end is interesting and unpredictable. This is something that today's movies lack, and what the movies from the past always had which made them great. Story of the movie if fascinating allowing us to see what the real ""mobster world"", underground world to be precise looked in the 1960's, 1970's as many scenes in the movie show us. All in all this is one hell of a movie and I'd suggested to everyone to watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Kilroy-17,10,28 January 2000,"Simply put, this movie is the oracle, answer key, the blue print, for all mafia films.  There has never been a better mob movie, and there never will. Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),drqshadow-reviews,10,28 May 2020,"The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Abhishek_Pandey,9,28 October 2012,"Well, I have seen a lot of movies in past, and will watch even more in the future. But, this one movie will always fascinate me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mickelmoney,8,5 March 2019,"When I think of an ""old fashioned"" Hollywood movie I think of The Godfather. Someone who does not appreciate the early makings of Cinema will not enjoy this movie and even see certain scenes as cheesy and not realistic (Ex. When Sonny is shot to death, the marriage with Michael etc.) But when you step back and look at this being something created in 1972 these events come to life you in a new way, hence the title of a ""classic"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),green5463,10,19 May 2001,"If this movie is not perfect, then it may be as close as a movie can come. The people who made this movie excelled in every facet.  The writing, direction, and cinemetography are all superb, and there isn't a bad performance in the film.  Coppolla captures the look and feel of New York in the late 1940s, then introduces us to an underworld of his own creation."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GC-GiORGi,,2 February 2016,"It's impressive movie that I have ever seen, I love Story of Corleone family so much! Every people can learn something from this movie. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ArmandoManuelPereira,6,25 February 2020,"I re-watched it today. My rating reflects that I feel it is over long, and not as vital as it may have seemed to audiences in 1972. Parts of it, in fact, are actually boring. Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NijazBaBs,4,10 May 2019,"Basically you see messy things like killings, distrust, disappointment, suspicious people and stories, sudden things, and it does not seem like it has ending, neither positive nor negative. Ending is like beginning, except that this time it is his son. Very negative and long. Not worth watching! Maybe good for older audience, as movie is old too. Old times, no devices, cars, or anything new I got used to."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hardenben,10,12 October 2022,"I do not like old school movies, but it is my number movie off all times. There are certain things in life that are so exquisite that 26 Alphabets seem inadequate to adequately explain them. They go beyond the limited scope of the 26 alphabets. Instead of rating or reviewing such things, you should personally experience them. One of the most exquisite motion pictures and television shows ever made. I mean, if they were able to make such high-caliber films in 1970, which the most skilled individuals are unable to do so in 2021, then the folks who built and developed this were truly ahead of their time. It will be unusual to see this 1970s-created, 1950s-based sitcom in 2021. I have a tendency to screenshot the moments that would make the most stunning posters."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),skylabviral,10,3 July 2022,"Unfortunately, today we can no longer watch such quality movies. This film is powerful, a good script, an excellent casting, an excellent acting and a top direction. It's hard to fine a film made so well, it's 29 years old and it's aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mobster movies, he or she will watch the entire movie, the audience is glued to what will happen next as the movie progresses. It's about family, loyalty, greed, relationships and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style makes the film memorable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kpahwueitoerey,10,15 June 2021,This is barely a masterpiece in my opinion. The direction and acting are completely flawless but it lack a lot in writing compared to what people say. Its pretty enjoyable tho ngl.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),akismastro,10,3 July 2016,"This film is one of the best! The acting and the chemistry between them are amazing. In this film Tony Montana is Micheal Corleone, born as the last child of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, the head of the Corleone family (Spoilers!: You see more of Vito's background in the second movie) , a big family in New York. But Micheal isn't like Tony, but though the movie he does some crimes for himself. The soundtrack blends really well with the sounds of the movie, you hear it but it isn't too loud, nor it's too low. Marlon and Al really make this movie. If you haven't seen it already, well buy it on Blue ray or watch it on Netflix. It gets only better when you seen all the trilogy."

The only thing that could make it a classic is the quality of the actors that were hired - and while the actors themselves can and have made quality movies, this one just doesn't do it for me.  Brando didn't impress me in the least in this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lindalindgren,10,5 July 2016,"Yeah. I don't think i have to write more than that actually. I think the most of you already know how good this movie is (or how good these movies are), and what the story is. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),albertobernal,10,11 July 2016,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),j-70786,10,26 May 2020,"The whole Godfather series is about the growth and death of a man, the rise and decline of a family. Brotherhood, father son relationship, rational and emotional love, friendship, men's sacrifice and responsibility in the face of family, career and love, the opposition and unity of justice and evil are vividly interpreted in the film. Countless classic lines and unforgettable plots.I am the same myself. In his early 20's, he stepped into the society, had contact with the world at the beginning, just opened the chapter of his life, and watching Godfather certainly felt obscure and gloomy. At this age, it's normal that we can't look down: we haven't understood the responsibilities and responsibilities of career, family, friendship and love, and we can't even know the cost of men's growth.When you are a little older, no one will help you or forgive you unconditionally. You are forced to understand that you need to work hard in society to survive. No one will give you money without any reason. Naturally, you will understand the difficulties and greatness of the old Godfather"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jonny-07642,6,9 April 2022,"If you enjoy action paced movies with great character depth and story telling opt for goodfellas. If you like slow paced, drama like story telling opt for the Godfather. It's wasn't my cup of tea but you can see why people might put it into being considered a classic. The movie for the time when released was ahead of its time. Nowadays it would go straight to dvd."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Chiller7,1,22 September 2018,"I don't see why this is supposed to be one of the greatest films of all time. I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too."

Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dan-rola,10,21 January 2008,"This movie is a timeless classic. I have never seen a movie that matches its excellence nor do I think I ever will. Brando rightfully deserved the Oscar he received for the movie (although his performance in On the Waterfront was better). The AFI list says Citizen Kane is the best movie of all time, but Citizen Kane doesn't come close to reaching the brilliance of the Godfather. Coppola got everything right and made the right choice of choosing the no-name actor Pacino (at the time) for the role as Michael. There was also James Caan and Robert Duvall that played their roles superb as well. I have probably seen this movie over 60 times and every time, I realize I'm watching a masterpiece in film. The character development is also outstanding. I would extremely recommend this movie to anyone interested in knowing about the great movies of all time. Superb 10/10."

It's always hard to review a classic and the only value I can bring to this world is that it's a personal review. I was a little apprehensive in the beginning that I may be disappointed in the movie as I was slightly with ""Goodfellas"", given its legendary status. For some reason, ""The Godfather"" felt ""better"" than the ""Goodfellas"" and I will making some comparisons between them . It might be the charismatic performances of Brando and Pacino. Perhaps I enjoy a more dramatic, heavier type of movie. Some mysterious factor made me appreciate this movie more than Scorsese's classic. I also think that the overall storyline is more memorable, perhaps because it's simpler."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),michaelpritchie,9,10 May 2021,One of the most perfect films of all time. This movie is a must watch and a must watch again. It captures society in the mafia era in the United States. The main thematic conflict is between good and evil and the decent to the dark side for the main character Michael. The movie has a great dichotomy between the purity of religion and crime. Francis Ford Copolla has directed a master piece in this first of the trilogy.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),miguelcastrogusa,8,23 December 2021,"This was the first mafia story I saw.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),apjc,9,10 June 2018,"Look at the cast, the director and writer, you know full well this is a film to watch, even if it's about an Italian pizzeria. Joking aside this was The Godfather of so many great mob films of later date. Certain well known Italians and Sicilians didn't like it, probably didn't run the studio and couldn't make an offer they can't refuse.Does romanticize these murderous clans somewhat, but does portray the Sicilian honour, blood feud and just business ideology well . This is a must see."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GOB-2,10,2 September 1999,"I have seen many many movies and this is simply one of the best. My 2nd favorite film of all time.

Be sure to get The Godfather Part II while you're there."

In-between, we had many films, ranging from innovative thrillers to a stunning comic book picture(Superman), from horrors to romance etc etc."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AvionPrince16,6,3 May 2022,"I was pretty disappointing i need to admit. But i wait for a moment and think about something: what they can do with a gang involved in a organised crimes, families's honour? Just some people who handling the business. I found also the start of Michael very good to watch and interesting to see. He is not uused to do this but learn. I found the movie pretty classic sadly. The violent scenes looks outdated now. What i found interesting i mean in the cinematography was at the end: the opposition of violence and the church scenes. That was interesting to see and look interesting visually. And the fall of Don Corleone make the whole thing more hard for the son, Michael. I also found the characters's arcs interesting and what they become. I enjoyed also the dialogues and have strong acts with families and honour. But it look really superficial but what i found really strong is the end: because we see the fall with the Don Corleone and the rise at the end with the new status of the Kid: Michael become the Godfather. And the image at the end was so meaningful and look the same as the father in some way."

Watching Al Pacino's transformation as he delves into the complex psyche of Michael Corleone is an absolute cinematic treat. From the very beginning, we witness a man torn between his desire to lead a respectable life and his family's ties to the underworld. As the narrative unfolds, we are drawn into the magnetic allure of his transformation, and it's almost mesmerizing to see how he evolves into a formidable figure, embracing the power and responsibility that comes with the title of ""Godfather."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dboccuti,9,30 September 2013,"The Godfather is a classic movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's about a mobster family where the whole family is involved except one, because he's a college student. The family didn't want to involve him because he had a good educated head on his shoulders. When his father is out one day, there is a mafia hit on him; however things don't go as planned exactly. Long story short, the dad ends up in the hospital and the educated son feels the need to get involved and help his father out. To my surprise, the son who didn't want to be involved finds himself completely wrapped up in the mafia lifestyle. "

We see the struggle of one family trying to run the business in a world where rival families will do anything to muscle them out of the way.  Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business.  Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding?  Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III.  Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all.  I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),WallyJT,7,3 July 2009,"Well I'm 15 and saw this movie for the first time recently. I must say although it was well acted, written and directed; it was somewhat boring during some portions of the movie, and there were some points where i couldn't figure out what was going or why it was going on. This was sometimes caused by Brando's almost unintelligible mumbled accent (my only gripe with the acting). It seems like there was just a classic scene, then some boring filler, another memorable scene, then boring filler, and so on. All in all it's a good movie and worth watching."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mitiori,1,24 November 2004,I also saw Godthumb first. Both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable. I actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies. But The Godfather...I just don't get why so many people say this is a great movie. Perhaps it's to be cool and one of the crowd? I was bored.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Morten_5,10,27 September 2017,"Yesterday, I was lucky to be able to watch 175 minutes of pure movie magic, restored and at a big screen, thanks to Cnema in Norrköping."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Xarnis,10,11 March 2013,"How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a ""masterpiece,"" and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ferdi_mushe,10,30 October 2020,"Greatest movie of all time no doubt. Perfect 10. Every aspect of this masterpiece is exceptional, starting from the cast and screenplay up until the production."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brahmmatrix,10,22 July 2018,"This in my opinion is the top of must watch list. The drama, the story-line, the twist, and everything about it sets the benchmark of movies of today."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),isaactopal,10,2 April 2019,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in film making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. If i can give it 11 stars out of 10, i will."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anthonymichaelbangert,10,20 October 2014,"This movie has everything a masterpiece needs. Excellent writing, compelling characters, and a story worth knowing. It tells of the politics of the Mafia in the 1940s, focusing on the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone is a smart businessman who decides to refuse to get involved with another family's connections to the drug business, thinking it to be morally wrong. When an assassination attempt on his life leaves the Boss in a critical condition, his sons must take over the day to day operations in the midst of the war that has been started. Throughout the film we see the truth behind the violence, the stress of being involved with a powerful family, and the political undertones of Mafia life. We especially see all of these effects in Michael Corleone. He is the youngest son of Don Corleone, and a war hero. However, due to the things happening throughout the story, Michael portrays a man's descent into a different life. Some great things about this movie are first off, the acting. Each person in this movie, no matter how small their role is, has a story to tell and they all tell those stories beautifully. Second, the language. Many scenes in this movie are spoken almost exclusively in Italian. Without subtitles. It added an authenticity unlike any movie I've seen before. Beautifully well done, excellently put together, an obvious masterpiece, even with being very slow paced at times. If you have yet to see this film, do so this instant."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Danimal-7,10,2 September 1999,"Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ronalexfr,,28 September 2013,"Although the 19th Century saw the creation of motion pictures, it wasn't until the 20th Century that films really took off. During times of hardships, audience flocked to their local cinemas to catch the latest flick, which invigorated Hollywood's movie studios to create imaginative & lavish films. This subsequently lead to the creation of some of the most innovative & influential films during the 20th Century. Among the list of 20th Century masterpieces is the critically-acclaimed film The Godfather (1972). Based on the novel by Mario Puzo & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather breaks all norms of the film industry. A phenomenal cast, a powerful soundtrack and an enriching plot propels The Godfather into a high standard of films. By the end of the film, the audience would be persuaded to sympathize with the Corleone family & their ""business"". The Godfather should be on everyone's bucket list for ""Movies to Watch Before You Die"". Stop reading this and go watch it if you already haven't!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),craig-hopton,7,13 June 2014,"I'd been putting off watching The Godfather for some time. Probably because I knew it was a long, weighty movie with a massive reputation and I wanted to make sure I gave it justice."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),idleguy,5,1 June 2003,"I expected a lot of this film especially after this was ranked as one of the best films. But to give it #1 ranking is way too much. I watched it and it was an OK film. The portrayal was real but a little too slow at times. Reality they say bites and I guess it was more like a documovie that chronicles the life of a mafia and his family. Facts were not the problem here, the speed was. I could find little that was debatable or something like that, just that it made me sleep. The sequel was no better in working as a sleeping pill."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cinephile-27690,10,24 June 2018,"When people are asked what the greatest movie ever made is, many people say Citizen Kane(I being one) but others will say The Godfather. I would not rank it that high, but I do think it is great. (I think the 2nd film is better, actually). It runs long at nearly 3 hours but it is very worth it! It's just such an iconic look at the Mafia. If you have never seen The Godfather and are offered a chance, take it. It's an offer you can't refuse."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rahel-photography,10,20 February 2022,"Best Movie ever, i have watched this movie with 5 of my friend last monday when i was in sulamaniyah, it was the best, and i am also planning to watch it with my wife next friday when im back to erbil."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JohnLennon1985,10,19 September 2002,"I've seen some great movies, but the Godfather is more than a movie. The Godfather is more than an epic. The Godfather was years ahead of its time. In fact, if the movie were to be made today, it would STILL be years ahead of its time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),msmika18,10,28 September 2013,"The Godfather was an excellent film. I very much enjoy a good organized crime film. I think it was a break out roll for Alpacino who played Michael Corelone the son to the Don (Marlon Brando). I must say it made me wonder if the Italian mafia world really exists, and if so is this real in-site. There were some parts that could have been left out, I did feel the wedding scene was being dragged out, I understand that was the only day the Don would grant wishes. I still give it a 10 even the beginning was a slow start. In my opinion I do believe Michael made a good Don, and we all knew once the Don had an attempt on his life he would not fully recover from it. Sonny (James Caan) the eldest son to the Don was groomed to take his father's place if a tragedy were to happen to him, so i was very surprised and a little sadden when he was ambushed and murdered on his way to protect his sister. I think this movie gave some real in-site to a gangster's paradise. It showed how the power can change from one individual to the next in a blink of an eye.How ironic the one son whom wanted nothing to do with his fathers lifestyle, who went to college and fought in the war, was the son who ended up filling his shoes. I would recommend this movie for viewing as well as Thr Godfather II to explore Michael's Journey as the new Don Corelone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jadennchhay-39626,10,22 March 2023,"The greatest movie of all time. The story, characters, and cinematography. I thought movies in the 1900's was a little weird, (Even though I was younger back then.) But I think people have problems with the pacing. It's slow, but its worth watching. It has the best sequel, but the 3rd movie sucks (From what I heard.) I honestly think that this movie should have done a clean Oscar sweep, but I am not complaining. Ever since I've watched this movie, I've started to watch much more other movies like, The Shawshank Redemption, 2001: A Space Odyssey , Creed, Rocky, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and many more. Thanks to The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),HasankaDesigner,10,5 February 2024,"This film seems to polarize viewers - you either love it or hate it. That's how I felt about The Godfather initially. To be honest, I avoided watching it for a long time without really knowing why. I assumed people were overhyping it, and I couldn't grasp why Mafia-themed movies received such high praise."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),myberlinetta,10,15 July 2022,I love Al Pacino Movie. The Godfather is the world's greatest movie and Marlon Brando was great actor I love his acting and Soundtrack is so great and beautiful.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),artwearsusa,10,22 May 2015,"I haven't seen a master yet like unto The God Father, while once a pond of time in America-mobsters is OK, or Mobsters as well is good, nothing has ever came close to matching the mobster action and masterpiece of the God Father. Since my youth I love action fighting movies, boxing, kung fu, and wrestling just to name a few. Why can't they make another Master Piece like until the God Father. As they made attempts nothing has ever come close, then again I can be wrong, prove me wrong. Show me another great all time master piece as the God Father Movies. And I will surely watch them and give you my honest opinion. While the Spanish version of the God Father known as Scare Face is great, but it has nothing on the God Father. Being African America the Old God Father don't even come close or near the God Father movies, never the less I do love the super-fly, that will always be one my favorites, Please anybody show me Master Pieces like until the God Father, I'm trying to build up my collection of these great master pieces. I get too tire of watching the master piece theater, while its great, it put me to sleep sometimes. Hey if you like to contact me at artwearsusa@gmail.com or go to my website at www.artination.com and share your opinion I'll be happy to read them and watch what ever you like me to watch and I will kindly share my opinion as well about the subject.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rwmoby,,1 February 2006,Upon finding the Godfather (1972) at #175 on the all time US voters list of the greatest films of all time - I simply laughed...
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shanekraus,7,26 July 2022,"This was a classic, and a very good film. It felt like the end game of the sopranos (just not done as well). I do not agree with everyone that says this is the greatest movie of all time (people also say citizen kane, or Shawshank is the greatest movie of all time), I just didn't enjoy the movie. The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing, which is overly slow. I still love this movie! I think it's funny that marlan brando put cotton balls in his cheeks for this role. This movie was fine."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bigtkeller,2,1 June 2005,"The Godfather is probably the most overrated movies of all time. I don't see why everyone gives this movie such a high rating. The movie sucks. The movie is just so darn boring and the only reason I kept watching it was because I kept wanting it to get better. I know a movie is not all about action, but come on, who wants to watch a movie that is just all talk and no action. Look at Scarface and The Untouchables, those were good Mafia movies. They both had a great storyline, great acting, and had at least some action. The Godfather is just way to boring and I don't get why it is number on the all time list. Some reviews that didn't like this movie have said many people like this movie because its about the Mafia and its influence. Those people who have said that are absolutely right. The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances were pretty darn good, but the story itself which carry's the movie is just so darn boring and this is without a doubt the most overrated movie ever. I'll stick to the Star Wars Saga instead of the Godfather Trilogy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),phelpssg-14952,10,2 September 2020,"The shot of the darkness of the crime and the lightness of the family in the beginning is one of my favourite bits. Not just in Godfather, but across both of the Godfather films.
The anger of Sonny and that being what destroys him and the nice gentleness of Vito, and what you think is a nice college boy, Michael, becoming an evil psychopath and how Sicily is like a back in time place, and Michael becoming Godfather for his nephew and his crime family at the same time is just brilliant.
I really can't say more."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sartaaz,10,19 August 2018,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather""
An intricately constructed tapestry of narrative, emotion and the trials of a reluctant gangster."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidcafor,9,27 October 2016,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organised crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptised while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptised in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed."

More than four decades later, and a generation apart, and to a culture so distant from mine, and still this film strikes as one of the most memorable. What makes it that was the question that not only haunted me for years, but also pushed me to study filmmaking and dive intro the subject.

He has fought heroically and returned home with the firm conviction not to continue his father's business, but to do honest business. Don Corleone and his clan grow richer and more influential every year, which naturally displeases other members of the New York underworld. By cunning manipulations and intrigues, Carleone's enemies first kill one of Vito's men, and then make an attempt on the Don himself. Michael vows to save his father and declares war on the criminal gangs."

Maybe it was a revelation back then but if you watch this in your 20s for the first time you may be dissapoited sorry"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),omygodgiantrobot,4,20 April 2024,"You may have bought into the hype and rightly so, for being made in 1971 it's pretty solid. The story if halfassed and the acting is mediocre. The voice and over the top Vito Corleone is funny in a sad way. This movie could have easily been cut down to an hour and a half and nothing would have gone awry. You could have guessed everything before it happened, very predictable. I just feel bad for the people saying it's the greatest movie e ver made. Maybe top 100 but I doubt it. Only older people who were blown away at the time by something entertaining still clutch at this boring waste of time."

""The Godfather"" is simply one of cinema's greatest achievements!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ladik_nik,10,29 May 2020,"If they ask me which films will remain excellent forever, one of the first in this category will be «Godfather». To the word, it is the color and storyline basis of «Godfather» has won recognition of many critics and lovers of similar cinema. The background, excluding Sicilian landscapes and grape fields, is less dynamic, giving preference to acting. The risk was high, as the producers of the film had long been unable to understand the situation inside the work, taking away Coppola's directorial powers, and removing Brando from the main role. And what is most gratifying is that the end result has already been recognized as a classic, and the leading performers will remain in the annals of history for a long time to come. Everyone must see this masterpiece! 10 out of 10"

The ending were the least suspected son gets 'Don"" is really astounding and reminiscent. The suspense shown was also extremely on point, when Micheal's newly married Italian women gets killed you don't know what to think. After when he returns it puts a strain on the viewers when Vito is seen to be supporting his son being 'Don' but you can tell that he does not like that deep inside of himself. Impressive acting made the movie really stand out and the ending would make you sit there and think... is there going to be another godfather or not? I rate this movie 10/10 because of all those reasons."

THE DON. His transformation shows how amazing Pacino is as an actor. Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don't find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eskendirov,10,1 October 2014,"A cinematic masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola. One of the greatest movies ever made. Marlon Brando made Don Vito something we rarely see in movies: realistic anti-hero, villain with million of verges. It's also story about how one good man (war hero) become a genius of a criminal world. Every scene was directed with the soul. Combined with Part II. In this movie perfect everything: perfect characters, adapted screenplay, and original soundtrack. Film about relationship between family members, loyalty, honor in life of gangsters and revenge. The Godfather did for gangster movies what Alfred Hitchcock did for Thriller (Suspense) genre."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rigi,6,19 January 2003,"I am not able to discern much greatness here. Very slow to start it takes too much time to set the mood with period sets and as a consequence does not have the time to make us get into the characters, raise our interest for them. For a long time it is not really clear on which of the main characters the movie really focuses and we thus cannot invest ourselves in one of them, but have to watch in a rather detached way the ""epic story"" of an entire family, their general mafia business dealings which to me at least are nothing new. The focus on Michael which comes only after some time is achieved with a scene where as a loving son he saves his father, then with a rather inexplicable revenge act which starts an all out gang war, and finally with a cartoonish love story which is also an exploitation device: the one full frontal nudity shot is totally out of place, and I am not against sex on film in general (the scene is however a direct adoption of Mario Puzo's pulp style, so it's at least true to the original material). All this is hardly above cliche. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheoneK,10,11 April 2016,"This film really opened my eyes to the drama of beautiful cinematography and how compelling you can make an image simply with the framing. Having each shot tell its own story is an incredible element towards crafting an excellent film. In addition to the cinematography, I became a huge fan of Brando because of this film. I read that he used some personal techniques to craft his character and I really admire that now that I am looking for ways to make my own screen-time unique and dynamic. I wish films would continue to use The Godfather as a model for good cinema. There is something missing from modern movie-making that can be rediscovered by watching films like this."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mperry35,10,27 June 2016,"I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, ""Omerta"" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime. Cinematic masterpiece."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dr_Coulardeau,,9 January 2007,"The USA have reached a point of no return in 1972 that is going to lead them to their final defeat in Vietnam and their tremendous decline in the world. At this moment too the consumer's society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrow-mindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass consumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The mafia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this « cancer » contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather's death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the mafia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian mafia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women. Francis Ford Coppola takes a very visible pleasure in this depiction that he complacently shows in its very minute details of cruelty and viciousness."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Velma-lgbtq,7,2 October 2022,"Few people are not aware of the existence of this film. At least because of private mentions, references and parodies, almost everyone knows that there is such a movie and approximately what it is about. However, if you read the short description of the picture or don't watch the movie very carefully, you might get the impression that this is just an ordinary movie about gangsters. I'll be brief. Although the film is a classic, it is NOT worthy of the title of a masterpiece. What masterpiece is it when the film is just stupidly stretched for more than 2 hours thanks to the dialogues, the plot is about nothing at all. I watched it only because of the young Pacino, and then on rewind."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mmitchell-04112,2,20 March 2018,"This movie is the definition of overrated, it is incredibly slow moving, half of the movie is dark. very bored after 30 minutes of watching. incredibly overrated."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),z-72185,10,1 November 2021,"Theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Blade_Le_Flambeur,,3 May 2003,"Critically acclaimed for it's unflinching look at the Mafia world, The Godfather Part I took him three academy awards: Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted screenplay. Marlon Brando (in his Oscar winning role) as Vito leads a powerful cast, who all do superbly in their roles. Al Pacino and James Cann provide excellent support as two of Vito's sons, and honorable mentions are Sterling Hayden and Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's powerful direction really flushes out everything in this film. Instead of telling the viewer what to feel about the characters, he lets them rather get involved in the storyline. The script too is amazing, detailing very particular things about the life of the Mafia, and also showing how corruption can even get to the nicest of people. The photography is very 70's style and shows the era the film takes place in very well. It's also noteworthy that this film started about every cliche in mafia films today. Whether it is lines such as ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" or just the assassination scenes, it all came from this film. It's a startling and bold achievment in filmaking, but Coppola could have also made the connections between certain characters a bit more apparent. Best film of all time? Not quite, but still close. 9.5/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alexastersen,6,26 August 2013,"Title says it all. yo. This movie is so boring. If you actually decide to watch this piece of **** you should contemplate purchasing a pair of noise canceling headphones and a blindfold. Seriously. I'm being super serious you guys. This movie is super annoying. Like seriously, remember that scene in Airplane where the women literally dies from boredom? That will be you son if you don't listen to me and decide to watch this movie. I'm trying to do you guys a favor. Would I really write all this sh*t if I didn't care about your well being? Also, by the way, if you pause at exactly 50:42 and scream ""For the glory of Satan"" you will get one million dollars. No kidding. Screw Peter Pan. That kid is so annoying. Like this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joekonn,1,4 October 2006,"Childish romantic view of common criminals; in no way equal to ""Goodfella's"" which really captures the truth about the underworld. The director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary Sicilian aristocracy (drinking too much vino), or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful. There are excellent performances by Brando, Pacino and Caan among others, but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality. The individual performances are wasted. Not unlike ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Godfather"" is an arrogant film with little genuine substance, and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter. It substitutes a yarn for a true story and, while it is entertaining, it contributes to the deterioration of our culture. Like the ""Gladiator"" it grabs your attention, then tells you lies. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),josianelessard,10,26 July 2023,"Definitely a classic. It never gets old! True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. Must see."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tohoanvu,10,2 November 2016,"I am not a big fan of the sequels even the second is a big step down from this one. What a cast? Like an earlier reviewer said; REWATCHABLE!! Yes, I am Italian, not a Sicilian, and I have seen it hundreds of times. What a cast: Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall. Even the supporting cast is excellent with the film noir legend Richard Conte as Barzini. Puzo wrote such a rich, deep script. The characters suck you in and are so lifelike. Each brother is radically different from the other. Fredo, the mama's boy, the useless one who Michael kills off in the second one. Sonny, the human volcano, with a temper that has to be seen to be believed. Michael, the quiet and deadly one most like Vito but colder more ruthless. Michael was always outside the family looking in; he was held in contempt by the rest as the soft college boy who didn't want to get his hands dirty. This is the answer to the riddle of how he could kill Fredo, his own brother, later in the second one. Notice where he sits at the wedding, as far away from the family as he can get."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ibnmahdy,,10 May 2016,"amazing movie The Godfather is a 1972 American crime drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945–55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[6]— and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[7] The film ranks #1 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[8] Ranked second to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,[9] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fwj89,7,3 April 2006,"This movie is probably the most overrated movies on IMDb, if not the most overrated. People on here are looking for too much out of movies and they aren't looking to judge them off of the right things. The movie was shot beautifully, the storyline is pretty interesting, but the movie is long, and dryly drags on and on. TO me the definition of a great movie is a movie that gets my different emotions running, whether it makes me laugh, cry, gets me excited etc. etc., this movie did nothing,I just sat there, I watched the movie, then I thought to myself, this movie is what people consider to be the best movie of all time. THe Best? H*** No, the best movie of all time should make my emotions run in everyway. I'm not saying its a bad movie, but its just not my idea of grade ""A"" entertainment. Definitely not number 1, before you bash me, just think about it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jamkorytoski,1,16 September 2004,"The Godfather is crap...it's a long movie about nothing. I would rather die than watch that crap again...notice crap is written more than a few times? That's because, this is what this movie is...CRAP! The acting is bad, the sets are bad. Overall this is junk. How in the world it's number one on the top 250 is beyond me. You people must have nothing better to do than to watch a movie where people get killed off because they opened their mouths or voiced their thoughts. I can watch that on the news. I hate this movie so much that my roommates are watching it right now, and I have my CD player on as loud as it will go, because I hate this movie! So in closing...The Godfather, all of them, are crap!"

That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since.

""Don't ever take sides against the family."""

Robinson etc We Love the Mob. The Godfather is nothing different. It is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. The story is a rags to riches story of a crime family that stared out with nothing then rose to the most powerful crime family. What I love more then that, Is the character development especially with Micheal from a war hero to a cold blooded boss. It is the story of a family that faces challenges from both outside and inside the family."

No one, will ever go beyond this film, it is truly magnificent. The film shows how the Corleone crime family want revenge on the men that tried to destroy them and there old beloved Don. Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando can been seen as some greatest acting that has ever been placed inside Hollywood. The famous line ""I'll make him an offer he cant refuse"" will always be rembered. "

Francis Coppola directed it in 1972 and integrated brilliant costumes, dynamic plot, detailed set, emotional sound track, and amazing actors involved in every scene the movie was one of the greatest successes of it's time and continues to remain a classic. I was born in 1990 and even though much as changed from when this movie was created to now, it is still a movie I can watch, enjoy, and appreciate because all those things listed above were spot on. This movie falls into multiple genres. Of those the largest is Crime Fiction. This genre crime fiction is the literary genre that fictionalizes crimes, their detection, criminals and their motives."

This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in ""The Godfather""."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FilmCriticLalitRao,6,13 October 2014,"When it comes to a discussion about the popularity of American cinema, it can be stated that there is hardly any American film as famous as ""The Godfather""-a film which has caught the attention of cinema admirers all over the world. While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in ""The Godfather"" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maniuis,5,1 May 2011,"Ten years ago when I watched this movie for the first time I had no knowledge of English and I was almost a kid. My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched ""The Godfather"" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),macrompictures,10,31 January 2020,"Such a complex story, beautifully executed and each and every characters done their job remarkably well. Well acted, well directed, well scripted- basically anything good you can say about a movie can relate to The Godfather.
What makes this film so great is how it develops such a complex character (Michael). He starts out as a war hero, reluctant to head his father's crime empire. Then his father is attacked and just barely survives causing Michael to kill the two men responsible. He runs away to Sicily and marries a woman who is later killed and Michael goes back to America and take up his fathers position as the don of the Corleone crime family. He ultimately sends assassins to kill all of the dons of the other syndicates, completing his descent to an evil gangster. Let us also not forget the ending. Well actually I could go on and on about the baptism scene and the last 5 minutes, so just watch the clips on YouTube (or watch the entire movie). This is my all time favorite film. The sequel is also one of the greatest films of all time. 5/5 stars."

Being well dressed is not about wearing the latest fashions; it is about knowing yourself and the styles that look best on you regardless of the latest trends. Keeping up with the latest trends is not only time consuming and costly but hard work."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stallone-9,10,28 February 2008,"This is my most favorite movie of all time.Words cannot describe its greatness.I have heard all kinds of stories about when it first came out and how people were constantly praising it but it's for a reason believe me.This film has the finest acting i have ever seen.You don't believe - then watch this masterpiece and see what i'm talking about.All the actors shine:Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,James Caan and the others were born to play their roles and you can see how passionate they were while playing.But the greatest one of them all is undoubtedly the GREAT Marlon Brando who was so eager to play the role that he sent director F.F.Coppola a tape on which he presents his way of playing the Godfather.Coppola is immediately impressed and hires Brando.From here it's all history in the making.The most emotional and powerful moment is when the Godfather gets shot.Pure brilliance.Every time I see that scene it sends shivers down my spine.If I have to be honest every scene has its impact and emotional message.If you haven't seen the movie yet fix your mistake and watch it right now.You'll be amazed!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ChoZen1,,8 October 1999,"I have seen The Godfather about 30 times and each and every time I see it, it still manages to impress me. It's not like any other ""mob"" movie that's out there. It's about loyalty, honor, and family which were the most important aspects of the early-day Mafia. It exemplifies every aspect of the commitment to keep a family together no matter what. The saga of the Corleone family, from ""Don"" Corleone and then to Michael Corleone, is absolutely brilliant. There isn't one defining moment; the movie as a whole is a tremendous masterpiece. I don't believe there will be another movie that will come close to capturing the depth and beauty of this film; at least not in this lifetime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),valadas,7,26 August 2007,"For mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for pleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),richardskranium,3,22 June 2019,"I am glad to see that I am not the only one that just does not 'get' this movie. It is spoken of almost religiously,and it seems that if you dare ask 'why?',your sanity is questioned. Maybe people are overwhelmed by the big-name cast,and have been told so many times what a great movie this is, for so long, and are afraid to say different. All I know is that I heard and read endless,over-the-top praise for this movie for years and years. I managed to avoid seeing it until well over a decade after it was released. What a disappointment. I could not believe I was watching the same movie that I had heard so,so much about. I was absolutely astonished with how boring it was. I could not believe how disjointed it was. I could not believe the praise that Marlon Brando was given for such a weak,lackluster performance- it is goofy beyond parody.
As the film rambled and shambled along,I began to wonder if I was the victim of some sort of obscure joke-this crummy film could NOT be the same movie I had heard so much about. Unfortunately,somehow,
the universally-praised movie and this boring and bloated bomb I was seeing turned out to be one and the same.
Watch it on a rainy day and decide for yourself if this movie is worthy of all the hype."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LluisLopezPerez,8,6 February 2019,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Max2lax2,9,21 February 2021,"As I was about to watch the movie for the first time, almost 50 years after it's realese, I was expecting it to feel old and outdated. I was wrong. I mean, yes, some parts like image quality and visual effects could have been done better today but they're still not bad. Once the movie got started it found a really good pacing. And the fact that the movie felt so real just made it more tense and engaging. Now, I'm no expert in cinematography, but I felt like I was understanding what was happening in each scene and not once was I interupted by an unatrual tempo or poor cuts. I can definitly see why this is considered a classic and why people love it so much. The question is if the movie really deserves the second highest rating on IMDB?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),obiethereal,10,7 March 2021,I've watched this trilogy over 100 times now I'm sure - I even have it on my laptop to use as reference when I need some life advice. I've enjoyed this masterpiece as a screenwriter and director and I've borrowed some wisdoms from both Vito and Michael to use when dealing with people. I would give it more than 10 in a rating if I had to. Always going to be the greatest franchises ever created!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),applescruffy,10,7 October 2003,"I read someone's comment saying that the movie lacked emotion. Now, I don't agree at all, I love the movie and wouldn't dare to criticise it like that. But after giving it some good thought, I can see what he or she meant with that comment. And it can be easily helped! Watch the other two as well! If you watch the three movies, preferably with no more than a day between them, you WILL feel emotion. It's a long story about people and if you allow yourself to feel for these people, when you get to know them, than you can't be left untouched. At least I personally can't imagine anyone not being touched. The story's so good, the acting is amazing, the movie is incredibly well made and the music is beautiful. So please, people, if you hated the first one, give it another try! Watch it again and watch the others as well. You'll thank me later :) ..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tizianopalumbo-52451,10,28 December 2020,"This is the definitive film! One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stylishboy004,10,29 March 2022,"Just like Muhammad Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) the Icon of Indian Cinema is the Pinacle of Acting in the East, 'The Godfather' is the Pinacle of Moviemaking in the West."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),looeydoggy,,21 September 2016,"The Godfather is simply put a masterpiece. I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the chance to enjoy Coppola's best movie. First off, the actor's performances are top notch. Al-Gore especially does an amazing job as Michael, always wearing a serious face, really becoming a very professional gangster. The other actors also contribute immensely to the film but none stand out quite like Robert Duvall, Besides Al-Gore. From humble beginnings as Bo Riddley, Duvall really has come a far way as he plays the character of Tom Hagen, Lawyer of the mob. Next there's the shots. Almost all shots have a purpose, from the beginning shot over the godfather's shoulder to slowly approaching a man sleeping with his horse's head. Similar to how shots serve a purpose to the movies progression, so do props. An iconic prop from the godfather are the oranges. Coppola places oranges in scenes to foreshadow that something bad is about to happen, like when the godfather gets shot he's buying oranges! The sound track was also very well done. The violins really give a mobby feel and how the music built up during certain scenes really helped build up tension.(Spoilers) My favorite parts of the movie were when they hit the driver near the statue of liberty, when Michael kills the opposing mob boss and cop, The final scene when Michael closes the door on his girlfriend, and finally, my favorite, the epic finale where each mob boss is killed of one by one as Michael becomes a literal godfather to his sister's child and the godfather of the mob. Overall, I really enjoyed the Godfather for doing everything right, 10 out of 10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),markjamesinNYC,7,1 January 2021,This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mr-kumar_ten,5,16 August 2015,"I don't understand why this movie is on top of the list, i din't find any thing in this movie to top the list with highest ratings. The cast did very good acting though but story not deserve to be on top of best 250. This is one of those rubbish old mafia films This movies always fence around the gangster family about there revenge story sucks, ridiculously overrated in the end all you found that you wasted 3 good hours of your day, its a goddamn crap its annoying. soooooo boring! whatever the reviews and rating says i hate this crap and I won't recommend any one to see this it will only disappoint you from what you expected from ""The Godfather"" Don Out."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),julieshotmail,8,23 March 2023,"Now I love movies in general, but somehow the so-called masterpiece ""The Godfather"" from 1972 has not appealed to me enough to sit through the darkly-lit, three-hour running time. However, I hear great things about ""The Offer"" which is about the making of ""The Godfather,"" so I decide to invest ten minutes of my time to see what this series is about. It is indeed a well-made show, with a good story, and I end up watching all episodes. So now in 2023 I just have to watch ""The Godfather."" I can see why this movie would be considered a classic for its time. It has interesting, brooding shots, cast with powerhouse actors, some not yet famous at the time but have since become huge celebrities in their own right. I do have issues with the movie's slow pace, some campy acting from supporting actors, like a couple of mafia sidekicks and the father of the bride in Sicily, awkward fade transitions between scenes, and some rather disjointed turn of events. But all of that is forgiven now that I have discovered the gem that is Al Pacino. I have watched a few of his later movies when he is already considered a legendary actor, but nothing has tickled my fancy until seeing him as a young, very handsome Pacino in ""The Godfather,"" who can convey a million emotions just from his piercing thoughtful gaze. ""The Offer"" is correct; you cannot take your eyes off Pacino as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather,"" even as you witness his gradual moral deterioration. For this, I give this ""classic"" 8 stars in 2023."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kkw-41765,10,3 May 2020,"It feels a bit redundant reviewing arguably the greatest and most well-known Hollywood film nearly 50 years after it's release, but I feel like I need to pay homage to this true masterpiece of American cinematic art. This is not simply a movie: this is a cultural touchstone, a landmark of human achievement, and a beautiful work of art realized by one of the few true masters of filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola. THE GODFATHER comes as close to perfection as any film ever could. The directing, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, set design, etc. etc. etc. are all world-class and I've never seen a film do better. Marlon Brando is stunningly brilliant as Vito Corleone, the aging head of a New York crime family; I only wish he had more screen time. Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable and tragic performances ever put to film as Michael Corleone, the reluctant heir to the throne. The supporting cast all give remarkable performances without exception; but Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale stand out the most. This is one you'll want to watch again and again, especially if you love classic auteur filmmaking. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, I both envy and pity you! A true MUST WATCH if there ever was one."

The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn't understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TayefAnam,10,21 July 2022,"In Terms of acting in this movie ,this is the highest pinacle for a movie can achieve. Brando, pachino, de niro all are Gods there..i dont know How many times I watch this masterpiece & in future i dont know how many times im gonna watch this. I wish to give 100 stars."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alpal123,10,22 December 2006,"The Godfather has everything that quality cinema needs, gripping story, a fantastic script and marvellous acting.The Godfather is an adaptation from the novel with the same title. Marlon Brando plays the character of Don Vito Corleone with complete emotion, meaning and accuracy. Al pacino's character of Michael Corleone and son of the Don. These two main characters grip the audience throughout the epic tale of gangland New York and the changes through the mid 20th Century. Through Don Vitos decline as the Godfather the reluctant Michael is dragged further in. Pacino performs his greatest part through this. The Godfather is Francis Coppola's greatest work among many classics. The story of a great family in the dark gangland years of New York will be one of the most recognised in 20th century cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacobmeyerjkm,10,10 February 2020,"I have no doubt in my mind that this film is crucial to the world of movies and the world in general. Every part was gripping, compelling, and emotional. I cared for every single character and felt for all of them individually. While watching this I placed sections into my brain for each character and started an emotional route for each of them. Even characters who seem as unimportant as Clemenza."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eduardsziborkins,10,28 November 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a masterclass in storytelling that delves deep into the intricate dynamics of human nature. At its core, the film brilliantly captures the essence of personal connections and the emotional complexities tied to the concept of family. Through the Corleone saga, it unveils the profound significance of loyalty, bonds, and tradition within the clan, portraying the love and unity that define their existence."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),srbijaoglasi,10,23 January 2021,I grew up with films like this where the directors tried to show even though it's a man in crime that compromises can be made. Today's movies are terrifying.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnhughwickhall-46718,,15 February 2024,"The Godfather (1972) is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the epic saga of the Corleone family, a powerful crime dynasty in post-war America. The film explores the themes of power, loyalty, violence, and morality, as the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), tries to protect his interests and pass on his legacy to his reluctant son, Michael (Al Pacino)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Soysoy,7,30 June 2003,"Well.... I finally got to look at the IMDB voters n°1 movie, the almighty Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alg11297,1,28 December 2018,"I saw this film when it first came out. The book was a wildly popular best seller and everyone seemed to have read it. Trying to watch it the other day on TV I can't imagine anyone being able to follow it. Too many characters, too many subplots, and a very slow pace. I've been watching films my whole life, and frankly I can't tell a good screenplay from a good performance from a good director. I do know that if I like the plot and the story engages me I'll be sure to like the movie. In the Godfather, scenes and characters come and go with no discernable point. I believe it's a lack of continuity or flow. Brando calls in Luca Brasi to keep an eye on someone. Luca is then seen in a small apartment in sideview getting dressed and then packing his gun. Then we see him go into a bar or restaurant that we've never seen before. In a flash there's a knife in his hand and a wire around his throat. Apparently the character was introduced for the soul purpose of getting murdered. Pacino and Annie Hall are having a meal in what looks like a hotel. She has the most impossible hair style I've ever seen in any movie bar none. They seem to be saying good bye and next we see Pacino walking down a street and into a dark building that we've never seen before. He seems to get agitated and notices that in one room a half eaten sandwich on the table and the other rooms seem deserted. Running up and down corridors we now have no idea where he is or what he's doing. Suddenly he opens a door to what looks like a apartment and we see Brando lying on a hospital bed. Out of nowhere a nurse appears. The audience has no clue that this was a hospital. All it would take was a sign saying Emergency Room or Surgery. Then to involve the plot suddenly a dozen police cars appear in front of the building. The Captain says he was the one who told the guards and detectives to leave. And now he shows up with more. And all this is just a plot devise to have Pacino shoot him and the other mobster.
There are countless meetings in this film that could have easily taken place over the phone.
The cars, the costumes, and the scenes all seem very accurate. But this film is like an endless dramatic story without end. Doesn't it remind you too much of the ending in Apocolypse Now with the same director years later?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Movie_Guy1990,10,21 August 2022,"When watching this film, you really can see and appreciate how many films that has come after take inspiration from this all-time classic. Francis' direction is masterful in every way, Marlon Brando's method acting in this film is immaculate, to me, Brando is Vito Corleone, ""The Don"", ""The Godfather"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Reviews_of_the_Dead,10,8 July 2022,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),1990sVHS,10,12 November 2020,"Just watch it, if you don't like it then whatever, but worth a watch. I don't feel like explaining why."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Steven Bray,10,23 March 2000,"This movie is simply the best gangster movie of all time and one of the greatest movies in cinema history from the very beginning every character is believable, every speech sounds authentic and every scene draws you deeper and deeper into the story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),talhakhank-66558,10,23 January 2024,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the film is a compelling and intricate portrayal of the Corleone crime family and their patriarch, Vito Corleone, played by the iconic Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bruhgmger2,10,3 February 2020,"It's very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it's hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don't usually notice (unless they're really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can't talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn't surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tavm,7,3 July 2016,"After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aidy,2,12 March 2001,"I don't see what all the fuss is about surrounding this movie.  It is long, slow and boring.  I'm partial to the odd gangster movie (yeah, I know, this isn't a gangster movie it's a 'family' movie...*yawn*) but have seen far better than this (Carlito's Way, Mean Streets, Scarface to name a few)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MrWilliams1987,10,23 April 2007,"In the beginning, The Godfather was the classic from the beginning. Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Oscar winner Marlon Brando as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Coppola paints a chilling portrait of a Sicilian family's rise and near fall from power in America, and the passage of rites from father to son. He masterfully balances the story between family life and the ugly business of crime in which they are engaged. The Godfather along with the other films in the trilogy, had a strong impact on the public at large. Don Vito's line, ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" was voted as the second most memorable line in cinema history in a 2005 poll, called AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute. It is often used in a humorous way. Reports from Mafia trials and confessions suggest that Mafia families began a ""real life"" tradition of paying respect to the family don by kissing his ring, in imitation of the ending scene of the movie. There is no evidence of this custom being mentioned prior to the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tlwyatt0801,10,5 August 2007,"I had heard so much hype surrounding the Godfather movies but I had never seen them. I finally decided to sit down and watch the Godfather. Maybe my expectations were way too high before I watched it because everyone was regarding this as the greatest movie ever made. When I sat down to watch it, during the first hour I was bored out of my mind. It put me to sleep and I cut it off and decided to watch it later. A few days later I decided to watch the rest of the movie and started to realize the movie's greatness."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iamshubs,10,30 April 2016,"The Godfather is one of the rare movie which makes us sympathize the evil. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gives out the steam of a real mafia Don. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family."" Like Babe Ruth is to baseball, like John Steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Never before have we seen performances so stellar, by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and everyone else! The Godfather has little life lessons everywhere. Along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gangsta,10,25 August 1999,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made.  It combines a superb plot, excellent acting, and top-drawer directing. Brando is great.  Pacino is at his best.  Add Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire in spectacular performances and you have a terrific ensemble cast. The plot, which combines a mob story with the moving story of a family -their lives, loves, and loyalties- is brilliantly written.  It can definitely be called the greatest film ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),denirofanacc,10,18 October 2023,"Whether you're an admirer of the genre or not, Mafia films have no better ally than The Godfather in defining what you expect from such a tragic and dramatic subject. This masterpiece doesn't just tell the story of killings and score-settling, it instils in its viewers values and ways of life that are benevolent and just a few steps away from the reasonable and respectable. As well as mixing several generations of absolutely titanic actors, the story behind the madness engendered by the thirst for power and money shows us that without love, family and friends, man will never be happy or fulfilled."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),npell,10,3 July 2022,This movie is hands down the best movie ever produced. The story that you see and the story that you don't see are both exciting and powerful. While action packed and emotional this movie will never fail to entertain me even I'd I watch it on repeat for a year I will always love it.

There has been comparable films in my opinion but it is in that elite class. No other movie could excite me thinking about it, like this one, The character studies were amazing, Some of the greatest characters ever. The direction,score was Amazing.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sarem,10,24 November 1999,"I think that Godfather made deep dents in the film industry. I can confidently say that this movie, with such enthralling and compassionate acting and directing, deserves even more praise that it is already receiving. I have watched this movie more than thirty times and each time is even more enriching. Absolutely no blemish. However, let me remind you that THIS IS NOT A CRIME MOVIE, but of mostly of family principles and character which is so lacking in so many other movies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sahilkpt-37461,10,29 November 2021,A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),artpixflix,10,31 October 2023,Title: A Timeless Masterpiece - The Godfather
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jameslinton-75252,10,4 May 2016,"The Godfather is a timeless classic. Everything about it is just masterful from the performances to the direction to the wonderful soundtrack. Marlon Brando effortlessly portrayed the cool calm composure of Vito Corleone, whilst Al Pacino was great as Michael Corleone. His transformation from family outsider to ruthless mob boss was believable and realistic. The Godfather also felt authentic from the sets to the costumes. One thing that also surprised me was how despite the Godfather being a three hour film, it is paced very well. I never felt confused or bored whilst watching it. It is an amazing film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Vike-3,10,12 March 2001,"This is without a doubt the best film ever made (at least that I have seen) not only because all of the graphic violence in it is used sparingly yet compels because it is edited to be kept realistic, but also because not a single scene is dumb or pointless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),skeletorx,,26 April 2000,"This is probably my favourite ever film, many say that Part 2 is better but I find that not quite the case. Although Part 2 has a deeper plot and the 2 different time frames, Part 1 is better simply because of the Brando character. Vito Corleone is one of the most recognisable characters ever on-screen and its Brando's performance that I really like."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mghtyroach,6,27 January 2000,"I think the movie was okay, but could have accomplished much more.  I, personally, believe that the movie was way too long.  There were a number of scenes and shots which served no purpose to the actual story line that could have been edited out and which made parts of it slow and dull.  I realize that most of these were made for benefit of the director's artistic vision, but art doesn't always make for good story telling -- just look at 2001."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tamarahasan-29408,1,20 March 2022,Fine if no one is saying anything I will this movie is overrated I understand why people THAT time (1970s) liked it back then it was something new and probably the most realistic movie they got back THEN but honestly there is SO MANY movies that are WAY better though I do understand why MEN liked it but honestly I've been watching movies from a very young age and this movie wasn't even mid it was low the idea is SO basic and old and yeah you will say it's an old movie in the 70s and that's why you need to let it go you just like it because it old and old fashioned how about you move on from OH THOESE WERE THE GREATER DAYS and start get nostalgic people who are like this need to move to actually better movies with better plot and actually more realistic in OUR time and honestly it was SO misogynistic and I just lost 3 hours of my life in trash.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,9,21 July 2021,"This film is definitely an important step in the world of cinema, the acting is great, the plot is great, everything about it is great. I however do not consider it to be one of my favourite films of all time, a very enjoyable film no doubt but in my view not something I'd put in my top ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Myitt,10,25 February 1999,"I really love this movie, and it is my favorite out of all three.  They are unable to fully describe in words, they are masterpieces.  This and the other two movies inspired me and moved me emotionally. I was crying at the end of the third movie!  I felt as though I knew the characters personally, and felt anger and grief and sorrow and happiness throughout the rise and near fall of the Corleone Family.  This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made, and you haven't lived yet if you love movies and haven't seen these films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gnthanishq,10,3 January 2023,"So,basically,The Godfather is a classic of old generation. It is one of the best movies with the best screenplay. Honestly I wasn't thinking that I would like this film. So the first 30 min was kinda boring but then the movie went to its peeks. I really like thsi film a lot. One of the greatest movies ever...........
The best characters of this film are Vito Corleone and Micahel Corleone. It was like Vito was the Man of the show and Michael is the man's Shadow. Characters were designed in a great way........
The Background Score was pretty gud too. Especially the music at the end was captivating and Impactful......"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pedrozemko,10,24 August 2018,"A magnificent work of art! Timeless. Exposes all the strength and human weakness, the true meaning of family in all aspects."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),suntek-31806,10,15 May 2018,"Coppola's masterpiece is the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. The actors are amazing, the roles are fit perfect to the actors, the plot is fantastic, and the music.... that music is perfect, it is terrifying, and give you goosebumps, and fit absolutely to the depressing moments of the The Godfather. I recommend this movie to everyone who can appreciate the pleasure of the movie arts."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MahmoudEllithy,10,7 February 2019,God father is the one of the best outstanding movie i have ever seen
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),avila-abraham,9,7 April 2014,"This Film is one of my favorite films of all times. I think that Coppola take a big risk after THX and Zootrope. This is a profound story about human nature trying to balance between the human desire of power the love of family. Every time I have the opportunity of see this film, I try to figure out how Francis resolve anything in the way to make a complete piece about the family issues, but in the same time a great portrait of the Italian mafia that today it's the ambiance and pace formula for the mafia films and also in Mexico the formula for the Mexican cartels. Also the great decision to invite a Al Pacino for the main role it's an excellent direction just below of the Brandon's performance."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alienf3tus,,9 February 2018,"Super slow moving and fatiguing to watch considering it's unnecessarily long runtime and formulaic structure. Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sside2075,6,26 July 2002,"The Godfather is not a bad movie. But no way in hell is it one of the Greatest movies of all time. It's not great at all. It's a decent movie, but it is absolutely overrated. It didn't even set any precedents or break new ground or anything. It's just a 3-hour long gangster movie with not interesting stuff happening. OVERRATED!!!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mackmason16,3,10 January 2020,"Maybe it's a generational thing, or I simply just don't get it, but The Godfather was bland and boring from start to finish. The story is hard to follow and lost me several times along the way. I felt emotionally disconnected from the movie and constantly found myself checking how long was left. Although the acting can be very good in some parts, the acting in other parts is downright terrible. It does not live up to the hype, for me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),julyateng,10,23 December 2020,"This movie make me know how bad this world, if you want clear the business you must be strong community"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dotdotdotanime,10,19 August 2018,"There is no movie quite like The Godfather. It was the movie that gave me a true respect for film and motivated me to seek out something else over those few family friendly flicks I'd see twice a year at the theater. Now I watch nearly a hundred every year and yet I've never found anything quite like this masterpiece.
It's the type you can watch over and over again and somehow find new things that make you respect the film even more. It's really an experience to watch and everyone should see it at some point in their lives."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JackRice100,10,14 November 2014,This film follows Vito Corleone the leader of a New York Mafia called 'family' having to deal with the consequences of ether moving with the times and going into drug related crime or sticking to the traditional old country ways of gambling. This effects his war hero son Michael who has no intentions into going into the family business.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),javierezequielhomero,9,20 May 2021,"Good morning. I can't say that The Godfather is the best movie ever, because I haven't seen all the movies in history, although I've tried about two hundred, if I can say it's my favorite so far."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),breelandmiles,10,26 December 2023,"I'll just start this review by saying this is the best movie ever made and I am not ashamed to say that. I don't care what other people say. The fact that this movie was made in the 70s makes it even more impressive. They didn't have the equipment and the camera and audio quality that we have today, but that is not what makes this movie great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),deram-77963,10,25 August 2018,Probably one of the greatest movies ever made to date. The carbage movies today can't even come close.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DennisDaniel01,10,19 January 2019,ALL TIME GREATS COME TOGETHER ON THIS ONE LOVE IT. I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN A MOVIE WE ALL GREAT ACTORS AROUND ME MAKING A CLASSIC FILM WIT THERE SPECIAL TALENTS IN IT WHY NOT .
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),papugomezxd,10,26 March 2021,"The best movie I've ever seen in my life and, of course, the best movie in the world,
Marlon Brando is just excellent as The Godfather, the performances of the whole actors are beautiful. Even the extras acts good(including the cat lmao)
I think this movie is the example of ""how to do the best movie in the history"". The best movie, just that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Eamonn_green,,23 July 2002,What? How did a film like this get a rating of 9? This bored the life out of me! For a start nothing happens in the first hour except a wedding! Once things do start happening the story is misleading and the plot is hard to follow. By the end of the film I was completely lost. Al Pachino has acted in better films(Donnie Brasco). Francis Ford Coppola has directed(The Outsiders) and produced(Jeepers Creepers) better films. 0 outta 10.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sedergun,6,10 October 2018,"At that time, the rhythm of the movie was too far from the present, and the climax was not prominent. It seems to be outdated now. At that time, it was a good movie, but it was ordinary or even worse than the current movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),herkules-jonsson,2,1 May 2012,"I just don't get it. Sure the acting in some parts of the movie is good, but honestly, the entire ""angry Italian""-role is probably the easiest character to play. And i really don't get how every other character other then the ""angry Italian"" seems underdeveloped, plain boring and uninteresting. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Xarx117,10,1 July 2022,"The Godfather is one of those movies that is good only for what it is. Some very dramatic moments, good dialog, some good romance, likable characters and a complete story. Its an overall very good film but not the most rewatchable in my opinion."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Habibi-Universe,10,2 July 2022,The Godfather (1972) 10/10!!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abracadabracosty,10,24 May 2016,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marglotfabadi,10,28 December 2020,"Obviously this is the greatest production of world.
Best direction
Best actress
Best music composition
Best edit and best story for ever and ever"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nevaleoncini,10,23 March 2023,"It can really be considered one of the best movies of all time. The cast is simply amazing, stellar. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert de Niro, Diane Keaton, James Caan and many others gathered all together at their most young ages in this masterpiece. The acting is insanely high quality and all of the actors cooperate to create one of the best choral performance of all time. Marlon Brandon is simply amazing, really beyond. The way in which he modulates his voice for the whole duration of the movie and his mouth position gives to the character such a specific personality which could be enough to make the movie itself. Al Pacino, who fought so hard for this part, is simply perfect for the role of the son. It's just incredible the depth and the courage with which he carries his performance for the whole duration of the movie, especially the way he shifts his believes. Remarkable how he works on the evolution of the character. Not to mention the sweat and amazingly talented Diane Keaton, who is just perfect for her role as well mannered girlfriend and later wife of Al Pacino. I couldn't recommend it more. It's one of these movies with an eternal energy; one of these movies people continue watching and watching all over again because of all the shades and other details which you continue discover and discover every time more and better. Go and enjoy!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kv-20578,10,30 August 2020,"I absolutely appreciate all the artists of this movie, And character of Michael is superb."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bradykitchen-33648,10,25 March 2022,The Godfather follows the Corleone crime family as they enter into a dispute between the 5 families.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mammad_Maleki,,5 August 2003,"a very exciting and interesting movie,including a lot of good acting specially Al Pacino as Michael Corleone ,which make you think about many things. a movie consist of cruel,clever,killer and of course lonely characters. a movie about violence,about mafia and about the life of us ,the true life of us."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mad_mandonna,6,22 September 2005,"I found the godfather to be slightly growling and over long, however I am not a gangster movie fan. You cannot put the Godfather down for it's immaculate acting and terrific set design. Marlon Brando was absolutely fantastic and never failed to shock with his brilliant performance. Al Pacino didn't impress as much as I thought he would, however, he carried off the performance with style. The hidden details within the Godfather are subtle yet enthralling. Attention to detail is duly noted and can be seen in many of the scenes, including where Michael makes his first killing. The change in character is subtle yet powerful and you can't help but wonder whether he's doing it because he wants to or because he feels he has to. all in all, The Godfather was a good FILM however I found it slightly dull but may appeal to another audience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jenniferles1000,4,8 February 2006,"I do not understand the big fuss about the Godfather trilogy OK yes the acting is top quality with brilliant performances from marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and even talia Shire is good but the film just drags the whole story is boring and the films just seem to go over the same things over and over again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MichaelMRamey,9,26 August 2018,"I understand that this film has been argued as flawless, but I'm giving it a nine based on two reasons from a personal standpoint. This film can drag on at times which can become a bit dull and Goodfellas I think is a better film so I can't possibly give The Godfather a ten. That being said this film still lives up to the hype. The story is fascinating, the characters are well structured and this movie can really bring out every human emotion in its audience. The runtime be damned, this is a film you can easily watch over and over again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ray_bradley,10,26 May 2016,"It is sort of disheartening to read the plethora of negative reviews of this film on IMDb. There seems to be a fundamental gap between those who understand and appreciate the history and the evolution of cinema and those whose powers of perception and attention spans have been impaired by mind-numbing video games and by a culture of total immersion in the utter banality of ""social media."" I even read one negative review which seriously attempted to draw a comparison between ""The Godfather"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I loved both movies by the way, but FOR CHRISSAKES! It's apples and oranges! One of those movies was a thoughtful, introspective ADULT film, which are few and far between. The other film, though great entertainment, was not."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Howlord,10,23 April 2002,"I suppose it's difficult to qualify exactly what formulates a tragedy.  Are tragedies about fate, disillusionment or death?  Are they about language? Must the plot adhere to a strict set of rules?  Must the climax come in the third act?  Well, my concept of a tragedy is when the flaws of one or more of its characters destroy a high goal.  In the case of the Godfather, this goal is the prevention of Michael's entry into the family business by making him a true American; the tragic flaw is Michael's inability to forego vengeance."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jake_GoldsteinStreet,10,23 May 2014,"This movie is one that has got to be on anyone's bucket list. It is a masterpiece that will never be able to be paralleled in film making history. While it did have its moments of a little too much talk, these moments were fine due to the large amounts of action and death. Personally my favorite death was the one of Luca Brasi, where he will be sleeping with the fishes along side Solozzo and Captain Mccluskey who were of course killed by good guy Michael! The death that saddened me the most was the one of Sonny played by James Caan. With his temper he was able to keep me engaged and entertained throughout. He was probably my favorite character. But the one thing you should take from this is ""Never take sides against the family."" Be sure to check out my Youtube channel where I do many top 10 lists and its quite entertaining https://www.youtube.com/user/xAdmiralCacti"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Zabala28,10,16 May 2023,"The Godfather, directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic gem that has etched its place in history as an unrivaled masterpiece. Released in 1972, this crime epic transcends time and stands as a shining example of exceptional storytelling, brilliant performances, and profound exploration of power, family, and the complexities of the human spirit."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),KaziShahAnas,10,1 March 2021,"I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience. Its tremendous work done. This movie depicts the sincere work with lots of love. No one can bring out such an epic movie, even if paid a billion dollars each. I just get up every time I hear Godfather to watch time and again."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),UACW,,23 September 2002,"I cannot express strongly enough how bad this movie sucks. Great music, great actors - but what does that give you? Coppola has everyone but his nursemaid employed in this one; Puzo's screenplay is pure speculation and nothing but - and the mob supposedly loved it; but people took this seriously: they really thought Puzo (and Coppola) had an inside track when they did not. And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled? No one gets this, but despite the great acting ensemble, this movie, its two follow-ups, its creator and director, and its screenwriter are the biggest bunch of hyped losers in Hollywood history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tbell-58449,7,8 September 2016,"I was expected a lot from this movie as it is ranked in the second place of IMDb top movies. I know that my opinion is oppose to the majority but here is my opinion. The Godfather movie is quite boring for me. The actions and everything are quite slow and in monotone. The shooting scene in the movie was radiculous and not realistic. The shooting is quite bad as it is an old movie which I understand. The story line is quite simple and quite straight. As I watched this movie, I forced myself to not fall asleep. The only good thing from this movie is the acting and also the music was on point. I would not recommend this movie for those who don't like slow pace movie or even a classic movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),didiermustntdie,2,22 February 2010,let's give it a good estimation
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),berkbolayirli,10,28 January 2021,"A francis ford copolla classic that takes me to different worlds every time I watch it, and deserves 10 points from me with its shooting techniques and fascinating atmosphere. I wish I was in my twenties when this film was shot and I could watch this movie in the cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dzsoltx,10,4 July 2021,"The godfather is the king of thugs. The shaping of the characters is all-encompassing. Unfortunately, such films are no longer made today."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),t_knox-19544,10,29 July 2017,"The Godfather is a film of undeniable triumph; everything from the set to the sound and lighting, the score to the amazing cast, is perfect and Francis Ford Coppola's vision does justice to Mario Puzo's stylish crime novel, with the author partnering with Coppola on the screenplay. The film is a masterpiece of acting and direction, with Coppola's influence clear, and the work of stars such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall centre-stage in a beautifully dark and corrupt tale of a powerful Italian crime family. Never has the Mafia been better depicted in cinema, and I opine never will it be again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),silviustefanhanceriuc,10,13 November 2021,"The only movie I have ever marked as a 10. Masterpiece! The actors, the acting, the storyline, everything combined made Godfather one of the best movie in the cinematographic history."

Where do I have to start?
Marlon brando or Al Pacino
187 minutes of intense waiting just for (what is the next move?)
It's like a game of chess when you have Protect the king ( the family) and to do that you have to move your pawn ( Michael) but on the way to win you have to sacrifice both of your queen ( veto corolonge) and knghts ( santino and tom ) to let your pawn flourish on the mat as a new queen controlling the whole board
10/10 is not enough for this kind of films"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),seanorafferty,10,9 July 2022,"Could not recommend higher. Does not matter your age, background, etc. And it is not nearly as long as I expected. Sonny as a character and James Cann performance are terrific and reason enough to watch it. Al Pacino is terrific. Duvall an Brando are great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jpgranera,10,4 January 2019,"I don't know how I had not watched this film until just a week ago, but I'm glad because this is not a movie to watch with distractions or when you are too young because you will not enjoy it as much as an adult does. I saw this movie and immediately become an addict, watched it at least 3 more times the same week. There is so much to talk about it! I found it hard to think someone doesn't enjoying this one. The cast, the great dialogue, big plot twists, all the emotions, everything makes it just great. This is no a film as many of these times that need a 4K quality to be appealing, you will not waste your time, every minute of the almost 3 hours is worth. You will want even more.
If you haven't watch it, what are you waiting for? (""This is an offer you can't refuse"")"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),triple8,,16 March 2004,This is the number 1 movie of all time-according to IMDB. This is a film that is as close to being perfect as a film can be-according to many. So-I am going to admit it straight out here-I have NEVER-I repeat-NEVER been able to get into the godfather-I feel almost guilty saying it-but it is the truth-This is considered to be the best of the best. But I didn't feel any of the fascination that many others did.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lky64,7,16 June 2020,"Good movie but a little boring, but it remains good and good for the actors"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alvinwasikkaoja,1,3 November 2022,"This has got to be the most overrated movie of all time. When I found out about this infamous movie with a score this high. I was 100% sure I would have a good time. But as you know from the title this wasn't the case. I can understand that some people really like this movie. But for me this movie was just an average movie way too slow paced. And that probably has alot to do with the age of the movie it is after all from 1972. I am aware that if this would be released now it would be alot worse but maybe if they had waited a few years and released it in the 80s it could have been better even though you all think it is perfect. Maybe I am delusional or just too young too experience this ""masterpiece"" as you all call it. After all I have only just turned 18. I would love to have someone explain to me what makes this movie so good otherwise I guess I will just rewatch this in a few years."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),creekin111,10,9 February 2006,"What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),parvizi_repair_furnitures,10,3 June 2024,"It is a powerful and engrossing story about family, loyalty, and betrayal. The film is full of memorable characters and scenes, and it tells a story that is both timeless and relevant."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spaalphaa,10,29 October 2023,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) stands as a cinematic masterpiece, an exemplar of storytelling, character development, and film direction.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mulder-51,10,26 August 1999,"The Godfather is a real masterpiece directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola. The screenplay, which is written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is just perfect. All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BrockHorwitz,10,23 February 2021,"One of the best movies of all time, so much talent behind and in front of the camera!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),theonewithallthecontacts,10,16 March 2013,"The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was ""The Godfather"". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rick_7,,8 April 2010,"Until a viewing last month, I hadn't watched The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) for a good five years. In the interim it seems to have got even better - if such a thing is possible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bluepink,7,15 March 2021,"Let me start with what I didn't like about it. I know this is a personal preference, but I think the main storyline was too basic for me i.e. X does something to Y. Then Y gets X back. The X's friend gets Y back. And basically repeat that formula. The only thing that really changed was the methods of the attacks. And for this reason, I don't feel the need to watch part 2 / 3. But if you like this genre, then I can see why you would enjoy this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dferris-4,1,17 September 2006,"Honesly couldn't see what all the fuss is about. I felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film. Good actors boring story and even worse directing!!! Perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently, and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers, producers, and directors? I don't doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the 'God father' sorely outclassed. It is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay-day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it."

His vision is to transfer power of the organisation to an understudy - ideally his son. With any luck, the organisation can transcend the crime background it was born from and become self-sufficient as a legitimate business."

Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sarabagi,10,13 March 2019,I cant count how many times i have watched this movie. And i love it even more with every watch. If you havent watched then youve missed a big part of film history!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),latke93,10,22 January 2019,"The best movie ever made, real gangster strategy. Similar to Miller's crossing.
Micheal Corleone is an ordinary, quiet Ivy league alumni, which is about to change when his father is wounded in a assassination attempt. Being a decorated war hero, and knowing truth about his family business he decides to take control of the situation by implementing an ingenious plan."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mjohnsonx,10,11 February 2007,"This is probably one of the most nearly perfect films ever made. A dark and twisted version of the ""immigrant to America makes good"" story is wonderfully presented. No small amount of credit for the quality of this movie should go to Mario Puzo's original novel. That novel helped make terms like ""make your bones"" and ""have a sit-down"" and ""capos"" popular. Francis Ford Coppola likes to dump on the whole ""gynecological repair job"" section of the novel but that seems like petty griping compared with the way that book gave him a can't-miss blueprint for the film. Coppola's change of the closing ceremony to a baptism instead of a confirmation was inspired but for the most part the book is so closely followed Puzo practically deserved a co-director credit."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iamitsingh-32608,10,1 July 2021,"One of the best movies based on the underworld. The story holds you until the end. The terrific performance of the actors are very much convincing. Overall, it's a must-watch for every movie lover."

Though Marlon Brando's appearance adds up to the whole movie and makes it something wonderful, the trilogy is still great. A masterpiece and a great piece of ART. This movies travels you to the depicted age and era. It gives you the feeling of completeness although you never actually find closure in the film since nothing actually comes to an end. Wish that even more of such films would find their way to the cinemas, but these days these kinds of pieces of art are no more the main target of producers. Finally a great job by Nino Puzo for writing the novels. A fantastic job overall."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),prashannamishra,10,19 April 2024,"It is hard to believe that it was made in 1972. This movie has everything perfect. Storyline, Plot, Twists everything just magnificent. Best movie of all time. Acting of every actor is awesome. Although it has some graphic scenes, this movie is worth the time. I have watched all three parts. Italian- American culture is shown beautifully. It also shows the beauty of Italian culture. Each and every character in this movie is different and unique which makes this movie entertaining and enjoyable with simple storyline. In conclusion, beat movie of all time. The Godfather cannot be compared to any other movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gmkim-82030,10,29 August 2020,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of the best films in history, and definitely the most iconic. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as its lead characters, it is much more than just a mafia film. It delves deep into society and family. It explores the corruption of government, the power the mafia had at the time, and doesn't hold back to portray the brutal life of the Corleone family. It tells a tragic story of how the well-mannered Michael Corleone turns into a cold-blooded murderer and eventually a kingpin. Throughout its long runtime, it gives you no time to rest, throwing twist after twist, and by the time credits start rolling, you will be rooted to your seat, your jaw wide open. Its storytelling is flawless, its characters are multi-layered and you care about them, especially Vito and Michael, who are essentially bad individuals.
This is more than a movie, it is an epic, a journey, an observation of how great men descent into the world of crime. If you have not seen this yet, do so right now. You will never be able to look at other films the same way ever again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lindaevellyn,10,25 March 2023,"What a Classic! Fantastic cinematography, all actors so talented ,they really make each character so remarkable. It is a must see movie , any time, no doubt about it! The story itself brings all the drama to a especial level , family, love, loyalty ,betrayal. Every scene was crafted to perfection when it comes to tell the story back in the previous decades , the 1940's till the 200's., including the locations, the outfits... All aspects of the movie are truly a great reference when it comes to acting. What an incredible saga! The music contributed to the movie to be an unforgettable one. Simply love watching it from time to time!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),The Big Lebowski,,29 October 2000,"Yes this is a great film, but not flawless. The casting is great, nice plot, some excellent scenes. However the pace is really too slow. I understand that some films need to be long, films with lots going on. But this is 2 hours entertainment, not 3. If this film had been shorter then it may possibly have been the greatest ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),michaelheiser-25099,7,15 November 2021,"I thought the film was very powerful, but a tad too violent for me. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny."

I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rshrmn,,19 February 2001,"Wow!  Let me say right off the bat that watching ""The Godfather"" is a hideous waste of time.  After sitting through three laborious hours of terrible dialogue, pointless plot twists, and senseless violence I was thoroughly sickened.  Al Pacino and Marlon Brando team up in what is surely one the most mindless, long winded, and utterly tiresome films of the century.  Here's a tip:  rent this film if you are big on self-torture.  Or do yourself a favor and check out ""Mulholland Falls"" if you are into gangster films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),manitobaman81,7,1 September 2014,"I remember I watched this as a kid. I am thankful for that. This is a great film with a tone reminiscent of other great films. The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off. The cinematography is stark and bare. In the bundle of all that it lacks, I feel that the movie is ignored for its writing. Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go. I suggest this movie to everyone. This is actually a serious movie with a serious message. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. I like this type of film, as it reminds me of German movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. Final rating from me: seven out of ten, almost eight out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shiftshaddow,5,2 June 2022,"I don't see what so many others see in this movie. It is choppy, the characters are undeveloped, it is not very well acted, and it is boring.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),b-04653,10,2 June 2023,"I like the whole tone of the film, it uses a lot of yellow and black hues. We know that yellow is a warm color in cinematic psychology, representing nobility, hope, and pleasure, but it also represents restlessness and ambition, while black represents seriousness and solidity, it also symbolizes death, evil and loneliness. The scene where the godfather' s youngest son appears in the early days of the film is very soft in tone, with his entire face under the light, and it doesn't have much of a sense through at glance , this is a native man far from family trouble. Later, he went on his father' s road, the tone also changed."

It is the acting in the Godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline. We see such actors as Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for Al Pacino. This is as far as i know Pacino's first real leading role and doesn't he grab the part by the horns! A Classic film that has not dated at all. 8 out of 10."

Also, marlon brando...i don't get it. yeah he was a GOOD actor, but i would never consider him a GREAT actor. and his part in this just seemed lacked something that should be there, i just didn't find him memorable. i suppose overall i didn't get this film the way others did, or is it just a case of people think they should like it so they just say that they do? i know that when people talk about it around me i don't voice my true opinion of it in fear of being hung by a mob :P"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amanvij,9,28 March 2016,"A must watch for every movie buff and specially for Fans of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The story shows how a man balances his work and family so well keeping in mind that his business is full of threat. Character of Vito Corleone defines what a real man is like and on the other hand Character of Michael Corleone shows how to contain anger and utilize it in most lethal way possible. This Story also shows how the mafia families have ruled the cities with both good and bad to their characters.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen."

I love this kind of movies in which the protagonists or antagonists are complex beings, with ambitious and colossal ideas, and that not anyone could do. The conclusions of every act and decision that Don Corleone, or of his son, are amazing, doing all to the big, I consider at all of one of the best movies that I see in all my life, and I will never forgot the sound-track and the landscape, that is the final complement that does the movie unforgettable."

Its The Movie you can watch many times and still find something new you didin't notice your previous viewings. Its the movie where you can learn more about the characters every moment of the film. Its the movie that shows the true 1940's mafia. It is the definition of a movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aperiroberta,9,20 March 2023,"This movie was amazing. I've always wanted to watch it and I thought it wasn't my kind of movie at first since I'm more of a romance or thriller kind of person, but I was so wrong. It catches your attention from the beginning till the end. It surprised me, made me smile and also made me feel sad. The performances made by all the actors were amazing, the cinematography was outstanding as well but most importantly the writing, pacing and music were all magnificent, clever and carefully studied to make this movie stand out. I am italian so maybe this is a reason I enjoyed it even more, especially in the parts in which they talked italian, though I'm not from Sicily so sometimes I didn't get the dialect.. finally, this movie made me fall in love with Al Pacino and Marlon Brando's acting skills. It gives you everything and relaxes you while keeping you entertained, so that 3 hours will easily go by. Thank you! I'll definetely watch the other 2 movies."

Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.

This mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),changwonlee87,10,19 October 2006,"I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream."

After initially watching the movie, I sat down and watched it again and appreciated the film even more. This movie is filled with classic scenes and classic lines. Marlon Brando is outstanding as Don Vito Corleone and equally good is Al Pacino. The scene in which Michael kills the policemen and the drug-lord is one of my favorites. The sound of a train builds and you can feel the intense passion of Michael Corleone. The transformation of Michael Corleone into a Don at the end of the movie is moving and underlies the central theme of family in the movie. Furthermore, the art direction is unbelievable with the footage in Italy and the wedding scene, both of which shaped film direction for latter generations of film makers. This movie is truly a gem and the best film of all time. Two thumbs way up!!"

It made stars of Pacino and Caan, won Oscars for Picture, Screenplay and Brando, in a triumphant comeback. Shortly after its premiere in 1972 Variety reported, ""The Godfather is an historic smash of unprecedented proportions"". At the time the director, Francis Ford Coppola, was holed up in a hotel writing the screenplay for The Great Gatsby, a job he took to relieve his financial problems because he believed in his movie. He had only been given the film after a lengthy wish-list of veterans including Otto Preminger, Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann and Franklin Schaffner turned it down.

Marlon Brando, with cotton stuffed in his mouth, gives yet another ridiculous scenery chewing performance as Don Corleone-the cat sitting in his lap was more interesting. The rest of the cast doesn't fare much better. This is one boring-assed movie. A lot of hand kissing, '40s automobiles, ""family values"", and the most lazy and repetitive score I've ever heard. This is a classic? Audiences must have been seriously desperate back in 1972."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Keith-berry30,7,30 September 2012,"The Godfather The film The Godfather takes place in New York and some parts of Italy during the mob era in the late 1930's and '40's. The story begins with a mob boss Don Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather, who conducts ""business"" out of his office. The scenes that take place here are where most plots and deals are being prepared. Usually trouble is being made when scenes take place here. Corleone is asked by a New York gangster, Sollozzo, for protection in exchange for profit from the drug trafficking business. Advised by his adopted son and family lawyer, Tom Hagen, and since he is not fond of drugs, Corleone decides to decline Sollozzo's offer. Following an assassination attempt on Corleone conducted by Sollozzo, his oldest son Sonny takes over the family business. Soon after this assignment to power, Sonny is assassinated. The next in line is Corleone's youngest son, Michael, the main character, who is a World War II hero. Michael had vowed to never become part of the family business but is slowly falling into the position due to his brother's death. After he is involved in a mob killing, Michael is forced to move to Sicily, where his father was born, until everything calms down. A movement that is frequently seen throughout the film is hand gestures. These are usually made as a signal for help, to kill someone or used to get a point across. An object that is seen often during the film is a gun. The gun represents quick resolution and necessity for survival."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),russ-189,1,1 June 2006,"Am I seemingly in a very small minority that find gangster films so soo sooo very dull. I concede that The Godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls I'm not so sure. And when I say not sure I mean Definitely not! I also admit that I'm not a Brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldn't matter if I like Brando or not, I should still like the film right?, and I just don't. My dad is the biggest Brando fan and even he doesn't reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon. In my opinion Carlito's Way or The Untouchables are far superior 'films'of the genre. I think the main problem I have with The Godfather other then the never ending dullness of it, is that it always seems to be saying 'oh look isn't cool to be in the mob, we should all do it'. Of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met, rather then being the message of the film. Not my cup of tea at all I'm afraid."

Marlon Brando's portrayal of the patriarch, Vito Corleone, is iconic and stands as one of the greatest performances in film history. But the entire cast delivers, with Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall turning in powerful performances."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),s_a_n_d_w_i_c_h_e_s,,5 January 2008,The following writing which you are about to read has little bits of things in it that might spoil the movie if you haven't seen it (which I would not recommend). So please do not read this OR see the movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mieriks,7,21 January 2023,"This movie, about the aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty in postwar New York City who transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant youngest son, brings fantastic qualities when it comes to the acting and the cinematography. Very realistic and stunning! The general life and relationships of the characters felt so real, and the production design was perfect. Can't avoid to mention the action and its practical effects. Very professional! I had a nice time watching this, but my main critic is the pace and the length. It was sometimes bland and boring, because I think there were too many scenes, or some of them too long. Some scenes could have been deleted or shortened without making any major differences on the movie. Anyway, a good movie overall, and therefore recommended!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),simplygk,1,21 November 2022,"I honestly don't get how this movie is so highly rated... it is extremely slow and boring. The only saving grace was Marlon Brando's performance in the film, apart from that, this film literally did nothing. From someone who loves a good gangster movie, this movie was absolute garbage. Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos way and Scarface are all amazing films and make this movie seem like a lullaby because it's enough to put you to sleep with its extremely slow and gentle pace. The movie runs for appeox 3 hours and going outside and watching the grass grow would be a more exciting thrill that sitting through this absolutely overrated disaster."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),QStrum,10,14 April 2000,"This is one of my personal favorites right here.  I can't say anything wrong about this incredible story about the Italian mafia.  The film is so good that it is mostly character driven, which tends to be boring to most, and with the subtle action, a person can hardly tell.  I guess it's the unique way the story is being told through the characters, how one man (Michael) must change all his views on life and morals to save his family, becoming a part of something he was trying to run from all his life.  At the same time Michael is working for his father's approval, even though they were on different sides of the wall of good and evil in the beginning of the film. I give this film an ""A+"" and a 10 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),doronzehavi,8,28 October 2001,"To my opinion, the most overrated film of all times."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dongorrizz,10,3 July 2018,"The Godfather is my favourite and the best movie for.
I've watched it over and over for so many times.
It showed me the reality aspect out of those ideal heroic epics.
It taught me how to be a truely good son, boyfriend or person.
It's such a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),akashparakh,10,25 May 2016,"In order to grasp the true depth of this movie - you have to read the novel. It's mandatory. To understand the Corleone s, the era in which they flourished & the times in which Vito made Don !!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Wuchakk,9,20 September 2017,"RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather"" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bnadeau33,10,29 July 2007,"This movie is solidly in the top 5 of ALL MOVIES that have ever been made and you could easily make a strong case for it being the best movie of every movie ever made. It was based on Puzo's best seller and the adapted screenplay from Puzo's work is absolutely sublime. It features one of the most stellar collection of actors every brought together for one film, with the performance of Brando leading the way. The cinematography is superb from the opening fade in back shot over Brando's shoulder {cat in lap} to the doubting stare on Diane Keaton's face as Al Neiri closes the office door in what works as what cinematographer's refer to as a closing wipe. Using the closing door to ""wipe "" the scene and end the movie, makes it one of the more recognizable and memorable endings to any movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xiaoli7377,10,9 July 2022,"Not a lot can be said about this classic that hasn't already been written in hundreds of reviews on this website and across the world in the decades since its release. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall are all amazing here. The script and the pacing are perfect. It's really a great story about the shedding of ideals in favor of supporting the corrupt criminal gang that is Michael Corleone's (Pacino) family. So many classic quotes and movie scenes. This is one of the all time greats."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dogsdildos,,13 May 2002,"Can someone please explain to me why this film is held in such high regard? I couldn't see anything particularly good about it to be honest and I'm not one for finding fault normally but I would have to say that this is a badly directed, dragging film with unconvincing story and acting. Honestly, you'd think someone else would have noticed before it got to the movie house, wouldn't you? If I could only use 10 words to describe this film they would be: Lame, Pedestrian, and Not as good as you think it is. So come on film buffs, let's admit the game is up, you've been found out."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jordyntsmith,7,29 May 2021,"The movie follows the rise (or fall, depending on your perspective) of the son of a crime family boss."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jack1141994,5,1 February 2007,"When I first went on this site, I was so excited what the top movie was I nearly exploded. When I saw that this prestigious position was taken by the Coppola classic, The Godfather, I was like ""Ah, not what I expected, but it seems deserving."" When I actually rented it out in the hope that it would be the best movie ever, I was quite shocked. What I'm trying to say people is DO NOT expect it to be the best movie ever made, because it is far from it. It takes SO MUCH out from the original book that you'll wonder if the book and the movie are written by the same person."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SubhanBakhtiyarov,10,6 June 2018,"Truth be told, The Godfather doesn't need a review. Without undue emphasis, Francis Ford Coppola's direction, Brando's and Pacino's performances are literally flawless. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nakibification-16,9,15 June 2013,"It's a great film in the history of film. Such a well sculpted film- making. Must watch to experience the true art of film. What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a ""MUST SEE"" movie don't miss it."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bhaimanish-38940,9,19 January 2019,One of the best trilogy made till date. Despite the slow move of the movie sequences it catches the attention of the viewer. A better way to represent the DON families of that time.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zby-new,9,12 November 2014,"The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aidan McGuinness,,27 February 2002,"I really like the movie that was temporarily #1 - ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I agree with a lot of what's in the charts though think some films here are over-rated. And this is what I felt about ""The Godfather"". It's very well made, etc. but it's also a bit boring."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),krish-andrew,7,1 August 2017,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xioned101,1,26 December 2003,"In my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater, or puts a feeling on you that you haven't experienced. You have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jokerpossum,10,27 October 2020,"This movie is incredible. It's the perfect story of family combined with the mafia. This is an amazing story of how power can corrupt and change people, and perfectly blends a balance of family into the mafia life. This movie truly shows the passage of time from the old ways of Vito corleone to the present day ways that do not suit him, and overall help mold the story and craft a beautiful and incredible movie that is one that everyone should see."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scallionandwolf,10,4 September 2021,"One never knows when one will be bested. Did Citizen Kane anticipate Vito Corleone popping a couple of cotton buds in his cheeks and changing cinema forever? With the possible acceptation of Shawshank, the characters, cinematography, screenplay et al have not been surpassed and it is unlikely they ever will be. If you haven't seen it you're a missing out. It defines the term classic. It is timeless and everlastingly relevant. We'll still be watching this film in six hundred years. It's the Mona Lisa of Movies. The Beethoven of Film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),baleelight,10,27 March 2019,Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amapiano,10,25 May 2020,One of the best movies i have ever seen
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JamesLeeCooper,10,14 June 2013,"I just want to say that is the fantastic movie. If you wonder the old New York and mafias you're not going to be regret for watching this film. In the movie they're summarizing Italian's Life in 30's. Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap- operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnnymarkka,10,29 September 2013,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The film can be viewed on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who demand much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but it is one-hundred seventy minutes well-spent. When the closing credits roll, only a portion of the story has been told."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Wilander,,30 November 2003,"Much like The Exorcist, this is a film that is praised my amateur minds, who know little about what makes a decent film. It has a few moments that brought a smile to my face, (well, one...when if finally finished). It's far, far too long, a self-indulgence that seeps into the rest of the movie. I found Brando's performance to be hammy, unconvincing and laughable, (how did a guy resembling a giant hamster control this group of poorly-acted gangsters?) Quite literally nothing of any significance occurs in this film, it's just an endless succession of mumbling, shooting, and glaring. I suppose that masochists find it entertaining, everybody else either A; Hasn't seen it, or B; Are lying. The ""special effects"" for the shooting scenes are very 1970's, ie, poor. It's no use saying this is a classic-to me, it 'aint, and i'm somebody who KNOWS he's right!! Watch something of true class instead...though you'll be hard pushed to find anything in the crime genre."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nathantyson-96463,7,30 July 2021,"Film isn't bad, but there are film much better with less ratings. There's no way this is a 9.2. Goodfellas was way better than this."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),el_slash,5,3 June 2006,"The book is awesome, one of the best books ever. Sadly the movie is weak, and fails to portrait the true essence of the characters, what's so great about the book is that you're able to know and understand the background stories, therefore you identify with the characters behavior to the point where you even forget they're mobsters!! however in the movie many minor and irrelevant scenes take too much time, time that could be used to go a little deeper into the characters, and what's even worst is the total disregard to important passages of the book which didn't even make the movie, or if they did, they were over-synthesized. I don't think I'm the only one that really loved the book, but was sadly disappointed by the movie, still is a movie worth watching, but if you really want to enjoy a great story you should read the book!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Taps06,10,23 June 2023,"Ah yes, The Godfather. An absolute classic in the film industry. With such legends as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and so much more."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),exterminator_99,10,24 March 2002,"Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by ""Goodfellas"", Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid.  Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society.  While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, ""The Godfather"" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law.  It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),habibhaytham,10,21 November 2020,"The best part of all parts.. I really loved it
Marlon Brandon worth the oscar"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Hitchcoc,10,16 February 2007,"So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of ""Deliverance"" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their ""labor""? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Stibbert,10,26 October 2005,"The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tindur,10,27 December 2008,"The Godfather is probably the most perfect movie ever made. A strong plot, a unique cast, direction, filming and editing are beyond words, and the music makes you blend in. There are other great movies of course, but some of them lack one or two things mentioned above. It's difficult to match this one. Francis Coppola probably did that with The Godfather Part II (1974), and he may have exceeded himself. The Godfather is such a masterpiece that you can watch it over and over again and you will never be bored but always surprised how wonderful it is. Just to see young Al Pacino change for a college boy to a ruthless mafioso is a miracle of movie-making, even more so than Marlon Brando in the title role, albeit a small one. But the most underrated role and actor in both the Godfather movies is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vrauto,10,13 April 2014,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Spielberg_101,10,31 July 2008,"And he wasn't wrong. After recently viewing this masterpiece of American film for the first time it is understood why it has earned such acclaim for so many years. It is hard to put into the words how beautiful and flawless The Godfather really is, all I can say is that it is the most brilliant saga of family, business, and crime ever captured on camera."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jag85,,14 April 2009,"Despite the film's now legendary status, I had only watched The Godfather for the first time yesterday. I've seen plenty of later crime films that were obviously inspired by it, so I was worried that the plot might become predictable for me due to my exposure to later inspired crime films. After my disappointment with classics like Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption (both very good films but I wouldn't consider them to be among the greatest) last month, I was also worried The Godfather might not live up to my expectations. By the time I was 45 minutes into the film, I was completely gripped by the film's unpredictable plot and the lives of the characters, and it just kept getting better as the film progressed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),funnygirl94086,7,12 April 2018,"I saw the film for the very time tonight and while I did enjoy it, I felt it was a bit overrated. There's been so much hype and deconstruction of this film over the last 4 decades, it's hard to approach it with a fresh perspective. Th cinematography was really beautiful and the lighting especially in the indoor scenes really set a glorious mood. I enjoyed the more subtle performances given by Diane Keaton and Al Pacino. A lot of the violence however, seemed gratuitous. The biggest flaw, frankly, was choosing Marlon Brando to play the Don. I love this actor and have enjoyed many of his performances, but this wasn't one of them. I thought he was dreadfully over-acting and ghoulish. It was a gross caricature and how he won ""best actor"" is a mystery to me! All the talk of how he had to ""age"" himself for the character made a mockery of his role with the Kleenex stuffed in his mouth and his put-on gangster voice was just distracting in the end."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),clearwinner,4,5 October 2014,"The only good thing about the movie was its style. It is unique. The second thing was Al Pacino, I mean he just holds everything still while he speaks. REally commendable performance. The opening scene was fantastic""I believe in America"" perfectly lit shot. After that everything is a drag. I get bored by the end of the movie. It has elongated scenes , I mean these so elongated that you can take a nap without missing anything. It was more like a opera kind of movie. So the opera lovers may like this movie but for me it was boring. Go watch it if you kind of love family drama said in a kind of some song and well love to nourish the scenes"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ellie_auk,10,17 February 2006,"The Godfather recognises the polar opposite to the American dream. It itself represents the ""dark side to the dream"" in a romanticised way using mise-en-scene and costume as well as Coppola's clever use of binary opposition with light and mood. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),griffolyon12,10,13 March 2009,"Every now and then a film comes along that is something truly special. Within these films everything seems to come together so perfectly, ranging from the acting, to the writing, to the directing. The Godfather is one of those such films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Spuzzlightyear,8,3 July 2006,"While I certainly wouldn't call this THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, this movie sure has a lot going for it, starting with the cast. I of course like Brando and Pacino going at it, but my personal faves are James Caan and of course my main man Robert Duvall. All of them give dynamite performances here, forever raising the bar to new actors everywhere. Even though the movie is 3 hours, it hardly ever drags, Coppola has a tight rein on the story (or maybe it's the producers doing that?) and it makes for a highly charged, highly entertaining classic of the first order. Funny as It seems, I only got around to finally watching this movie last year. Although I'm not exactly doing facepalms over the fact I've waited this long to see it, this movie will never grow old with me,"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Discern,1,26 March 1999,"A ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes.  After about 20 minutes of this tripe I wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them -- for the good of humanity.  With few exceptions (Pacino) the acting was also of low caliber.  All the money spent on the sets, costumes, and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storyline."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lisa-cena,10,17 August 2008,I first watched this movie a few months ago and I loved it. I decided to watch it since I had heard it was one of the best movies ever made. And I now agree with those who said that. I thought that this is one of the best movies as it was well scripted and the characters were strong. Francis Ford Coppola casted some of the best actors for this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),richarevans1,10,12 August 2003,"This film has everything - Great actors at the top of their game, a brilliant and realistic story, a top director, brilliant cinematography, wonderfully evocative post war costumes and cars, brilliant scenes (horses head, restaurant shooting scene, hospital scene etc.) and a score that adds to the film without overpowering it. At first look it would seem to be a film about a family of gangsters, but I think that what it really is is a story of how a good, intelligent man, a war hero, can become a monster by degrees. Godfather II is probably superior but it couldn't have been made without this film. A true masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ferguson-6,10,3 March 2012,"Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. ""I believe in America."" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Movie_Muse_Reviews,10,22 June 2008,"If you're reading this comment to decide if you should watch ""The Godfather,"" then I truly have no comment to that. That would mean that the #1 of 250 ranking on the title page, the name ""Francis Ford Coppola,"" the cast list including Marlon Brando, the ""won Oscar for best picture"" and the phrase ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" mean absolutely nothing to you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ofpsmith,10,31 January 2015,"One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vito's only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vito's bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleone's lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and it's easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because that's what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),loccomotive2000,10,21 September 2008,"How do you define a movie's greatness? For me, it's pretty straightforward; mainly the direction, the script, and the acting. And the Godfather triumphs on every level. Coppola and Puzo have created an epic tale of a powerful mafioso patriarch passing his crown down to his unwilling son, and the shift of power unfolds brilliantly with betrayal, vengeance and tragedy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),akash_sebastian,9,17 July 2014,"'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),silentium,10,4 July 2003,"The entire scale for this movie is huge, and every scene carries emotions with it. The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Satyabrata14,6,13 November 2020,"I find this movie a little bit boring at some part but u will enjoy it if u like gangster thriller type movie.
A classic movie
The acting in this movie is top class
I enjoyed this movie basically due to those top class acting"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),numberonecubsfan,1,4 July 2003,"I will never, ever understand the love affiar people have with this movie. It is completely and utterly over-rated. Marlon Brando is not the god of an actor he and people make him out to be. Neither is Al Pachino for that matter. The acting is pretty stiff and unbelieveable. It was so freaking LONG. Ugh, I hate this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),felipehistory,10,21 January 2014,"Many words have been written about ""The Godfather"" since debut in 1972 and no doubt that all words are quite flattering, but always worth a few cents more about this great movie. The work, directed by then newcomer director Coppola, was awarded in the launch year and continued to receiving well-deserved awards, until soon became a landmark of international cinema . With substantial actors and flawless performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the story has traces of a true work of art. Its soundtrack also awarded, is absolutely amazing and remarkable. Who does not hear the chords of the soundtrack by Nino Rota and automatically remember the movie ?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),itamarscomix,10,27 September 2011,"It's a difficult word to cope with. It's a word that I try to toss around as little as possible. But there's just no other word. The Godfather isn't necessarily my favorite film of all time, it's not necessarily the best film of all time, but it's just that: perfect."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gavin6942,8,17 August 2006,"The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked ""The Godfather"" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me ""Citizen Kane"" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be ""Scarface"". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),freemantle_uk,10,22 April 2008,"There is no denying that the Godfather is a classic and one of the best movies ever made. It is a saga of a major Mafia father, the upper echelons and there struggles. It starts with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the day of his daughter's wedding and doing favours for people invited to the wedding. The films shows the outcome of these favours, including the famous sense of the horse's head in the bed. The film then shows Vito refusing to take part in selling drugs and ends up having an assassination attempt against him. The Corleone family is forced into a tuft war before peace is made. At the same time the Godfather shows Michael's (Al Panico) rise in the family, from being a bit of an outsider not wanting to get involved to becoming the head of family after Vito's death. The film shows how person relationships developed and shows the characters as real people. It shows how the Mafia would have worked in the 1950s, focusing on deal making, rising up the ranks and showing acts of violence being conducted."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10,16 July 2004,"I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),exusninja,9,9 February 2006,This is probably the best mob movie of all time which captures the old mob dramatics of the 1920-30s with the more business savvy mobs of the 1950-60s. It links the classic capones with the modern gambinos.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MovieAddict2016,10,19 April 2008,"The movie opens at Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) home in the 1950s. His daughter is being wed and the entire ""family"" has come to celebrate. Vito's son Michael (Al Pacino), the most ""Americanized"" of his immediate family, has rejected the traditions of his ancestors and joined the army. He has no plans of becoming an errand boy for his father."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),qg59,10,21 July 2006,"I think what made this movie so great was the actors. The directing was also very superb. As i watched this movie, 30 plus years or so after it was made, i totally was engulfed in what was going on in the movie. Most great movies that i see that are older seem to be dull and boring, not this one. Yes it is long, and i had to take frequent breaks, it was far from boring. This is one of those movies that after i saw it i started acting like i was in a mob family. I started saying ""I'm going to make him an offer he cant refuse."" This movie is a great movie that mixes all kinds of genres, from romance to action, but it is mostly a full out drama. This movie is defiantly deserving of the top honor for best movie. I recommend it to all people, and even if you cant appreciate the plot, you have to appreciate the acting. By far the best acting in any film i have ever seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ManoffKINO,,1 July 2013,This movie is one of my favorites but I do have some problems with it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ender1708,7,20 July 2006,"The first thing i have to say is that it's way too long and you can barely get through it, part of this is because there are too many extended scenes in it. Granted it's a good movie, but not by any chance the best movie ever made and not better than The Shawshank Redemption (i'm comparing it to Shawshank because they are the 2 leading movies in the IMDb top). The acting is great, the script is good and the directing is OK, but that doesn't make it the best movie ever made. There's almost no foreshadowing in it, there are no major twists in the plot thus making the storyline actually a straight line and there's nothing in the movie that surprises you. When i watched it i was at the edge of boredom and was hoping something would show up in that movie that would pull me back. It's true that it was a very daring movie at the time, but still that alone doesn't make a movie great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DesheshHub,1,26 April 2020,"When a director tries to romanticize what shouldn't romanticized such like mob crimes, prostitution laundry money works, Drugs dealing.. all this goofy stuff to present an evil version of robin hood who tries to justify a weak folks,protect his family and Pushing you in the same uncomfortable corner that your boring philosophy professor about morality , hence that fake masterpiece is the result."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rossrobinson,10,3 November 2003,"The Godfather is a fantastic movie to watch. The story to it is just fantastic. I don't think you could beat a movie like this, but as well as the other fantastic movies, the godfather is one of the classics i think of all time. This is top of the imdb list as it's the number 1 top 250 movie at the moment, it has been for a long time and i would think it would take some beating to knock this movie off the 250 top movies list. I think that there won't be a better movie that would top the 250 best movies ever, because the godfather is an amazing movie and it is fantastic. I give this movie 10 out of 10."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),reggaemuzik,10,1 January 2008,"The Godfather is the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando played his part so well. Al Pacino also played is part well as well. The setting was fantastic and the plot was engaging. The use of camera work was just outstanding. I don't know why anyone would hate this film. It is the best gangster/mobster ever produced. This movie is way better than 'Goodfellas' or 'Scarface'. This movie had so many Oscar winning actors which boosted the rating of this movie right up. There are some action scenes in this movie and they are fantastic to watch. But the best part of the movie has to be the acting and how engaging the characters are. For everyone who was reluctant to get this movie, I suggest you buy this film or hire it out because it is a blast."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sadri_81,10,5 August 2002,"The Godfather is one of the best movies ever, the movie is made for 30 years ago and it´s the best movie i ever seen and will see. If you think "" Casino"", or "" Goodfellas"", is a great gangster movie than you should see The Godfather all parts. I recommend this movie to all over 18 so they can see the beauty on this, i dont really belive the teenager will see that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),caspian1978,10,15 April 2001,"This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),andrei-93,10,27 July 2008,"I have been looking for a better film than this one for a long time, i have been looking for better acting, directing or writing but i haven't find it yet, not even the great geniuses of Bergman or Fellini have deliver us with such a masterpiece. Brando at his best, and the big appearances of such actors as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire and many others. The writing is superb, i've read the book, and together with the film they are both my favorites, and the directing is Coppola getting the whole essence of the honor, respect, devotion, love, desire and revenge. is totally illogical that two films like the dark knight or the The Shawshank Redemption (great films by the way) are better voted that this, the greatest masterpiece on cinematic history"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Castor-5,,29 February 2000,"Most say this is the best film in the history of film.  That statement is just about as true as they come.  Some say it's not the best film in the history of film.  That statement is also true, The Godfather II is equally as good and can be considered the best.  Then some say it doesn't even make their top 10.  That statement tells you that that person hasn't seen enough films. Finally there are some that say this film sucks.  Those people are an absolute disgrace to the history of film entirely and shouldn't comment on another film as long as they live. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),filipekholm,10,27 June 2008,What is there to say about The Godfather? That it is one of the best movies ever we all already know. What makes me like it so much? It was the movie that got me interested in the Movie industry. The movie that touched me so much i immediately knew that I wanted to make movies. Without this movie my life wouldn't look like it does today. But it isn't just me that this movie has affected. The whole world loves it and hails it as one of the best movies ever. Some (including me) even ranks it as THE best movie ever.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),juanmendoza333,10,26 August 2014,"It's really hard to argue against this film as the greatest of all time. The Godfather is one of those rare instances where incredible plot meets incredible interpretation. It has Iconic performances to iconic characters. Dialogues that are bursting with quotes, style, and even wisdom. Themes that resonate immediately with anyone: family, loyalty, honor, power, revenge, legacy. Etc."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PeterWilliamson,10,5 April 2008,"Francis Ford Capolla's The Godfather is perfect, faultless and gripping. This film will really not stop sticking you to your chair. Al Pacino's second feature film and no doubt his best. His character is lovable and thrilling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nrr817,10,31 January 2014,"There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, ""a film you can't refuse,"" etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),showtime-14,10,16 October 2008,"What i wanted to say has already been said countless times. Ill make this short. First off i love the Godfather. This is on my 10 favorite films of all time. We all know its top 3 material but when Steven Spielberg claims to have almost retired after seeing this movie because he feared that he could never make a movie of the same magnitude as the Godfather, thats saying something coming from arguably the best film maker of the last 25 years. I wanna say that this is the best film in history but thats really a matter of ones opinion and taste. Whether its better or worse than citizen Kane is your opinion, mine goes with the Godfather. Not that Citizen Kane is far off but what are we judging on here, The films impact, or the Film it self. Citizen is judged by its impact of every film that came after it. As a film it self, I don't feel it matches up to the Godfather nor gone with the wind or Schindlers list Given the difference in eras that they were all made. But hey, thats just me. Tons of Top directors believe that the Godfather is probably the greatest. M Night Shyamalan, Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. Thats some good Company there. I believe the experts."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mcsheehey,10,26 May 2007,"""The Godfather"" is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),HelloTexas11,10,20 May 2008,"A few thoughts and observations on an American classic- I doubt 'The Godfather' was shot sequentially (hardly any movies are) but it sure seems to me that the first scene, the wedding scene, was also the first one filmed. The reason I say this is that none of the actors seem completely comfortable with their characters yet; it's as though they're still figuring them out, unlike later in the film, where almost all the actors absolutely inhabit their roles. The same goes for the direction and dialogue, which contains some heavy-handed exposition that is noticeably missing later on too. (Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen tells his wife at one point that he has to go back to work because no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. Oh really? His wife never knew this? She's finding out just now, in the middle of the festivities?) As Sonny, James Caan is still working on his swagger, and even Marlon Brando is shown at his desk, holding a cat and stroking it, as though he's auditioning to be the next James Bond villain. (There are no further shots of him holding a cat.) This early awkwardness soon passes but the next scene is just as confounding, in a different way. Hagen is sent to California to convince a Hollywood producer to give a movie role to Johnny Fontaine, Don Corleone's godson. This scene sticks out like a sore thumb now and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, despite providing 'The Godfather' with one of its most famous images, that of the severed horse-head in the movie producer's bed. No, it's only when Hagen returns to New York that the film really begins. The first several times I saw 'The Godfather,' I had a difficult time breaking it down into segments and sections, as in what happened in relation to other things going on in the film. This of course is the sign of smart scripting and directorial slight-of-hand, and clever pacing which keeps you guessing. For instance, the different scenes where Luca Brazi is killed, then Don Corleone is shot, Tom Hagen is briefly kidnapped by Sallozzo, and Michael Corleone finds out what has happened. These all seem to happen at roughly the same time, but Michael finds out from a newspaper! Yet one never questions it while watching. There are so many great and famous scenes, it's hard to pick favorites, but I notice now when I watch it, I particularly enjoy the one where Don Corleone and his inner circle meet with Sallozzo, just before the aforementioned violence. It's one of the few times in the lengthy film where we actually get to see the Don at work guiding his empire and making decisions. Not a great deal happens in the scene, but it's a good example of Don Corleone's thinking and helps explain why he is held in such high regard, why he is in fact the 'irreplaceable man', as will soon become apparent. Sonny is obviously to be his successor, and just as obviously lacks the old man's reasoning and negotiating skills. Fredo is just another body in the room and Michael isn't yet ""with"" them. Despite the incredible wealth and influence we've seen the Corleone family possess, this scene and its immediate aftermath show just how fragile and tenuous its grip on power is in dangerous circumstances. The relative ease with which the Don is set up and shot, as well as the quick dispensing of his main hit-man, Luca Brazi (who had been portrayed as almost invincible), proves that Sallozzo was correct, in the short term anyway: get rid of the Don and his empire collapses into confusion. The rest of the film is more or less the laying out of a careful and methodical revenge plotted by both Michael and the old Don, following a major subplot having to do with Michael hiding out in Sicily after killing Sallozzo and a New York police captain. It all leads to perhaps the most famous scene of all in 'The Godfather,' the baptism sequence where everyone who plotted against the Corleones get their comeuppance, from Connie's husband Carlo to the rival Mafia chieftains who hoped to exploit the Corleone family's momentary weakness. That it feels like justice being served says something about how Coppola has successfully manipulated the audience into rooting for the Corleones. The word 'adventure' doesn't usually come to mind when discussing 'The Godfather,' but that's what it is, an astonishing adventure for the characters and an eye-opening look inside a powerful crime family for the audience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Reijo_Kemppainen,10,25 April 2003,I think the Godfather is the greatest movie which is ever made.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrmoviefreak261-1,10,29 November 2008,"Godfather is a one of a kind film. Nothing can ever beat this kind of story, with the Mafia and organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film. Watch it, and be sure to watch the second one also."

The movie was so well made, great story telling, great acting, and a vivid look at a time gone by in American history.  What is really funny is that reading the comments you find two or three people that say this movie was junk.  To say it is not the best of all time is one thing, I like Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia better myself, but to say that this was a bad movie is unthinkable.

I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jussi-kangas,10,22 January 2009,I must say that I did not like Godfather when i saw it for the first time. This may have something to do with the fact that i was 10 years old and loved Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies. I watched it again when i was 17 and i was blown away by the beauty (and tragedy) of the movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Macintoxic,10,13 February 2015,"The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art. As filmmaking and storytelling, 'The Godfather' remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),intel_inside123,10,13 June 2006,This movie deserves its place on the top of IMDb's top 250 list. The acting is excellent nobody did bad in this film even the extras. The cinematography was beautiful showing New York in the World War Two era with great authenticity. If you have not seen this excellent movie then you should rent a copy and if you enjoy it buy the box set and watch the entire collection. I believe even the third movie was a masterpiece most people did not like that one because the movie was a little fast paced without any relaxed and beautiful moments like the first two. I believe that everybody should see this movie and even if it doesn't show the Mafia realistically it is still an American Masterpiece and should be watched by everyone.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CueTee,10,17 October 2003,"The most perfect film ever made.  I watched it with my father when I was young (probably too young).  I have since seen it at least 50 times.  The direction, acting, costume and production is faultless.  There are so many scenes that will be remembered forever.  So many lines that people just know from memory.  The music is also sublime.  Pacino for me steals the show (and what a show).  Maybe only because he has more memorable scenes.  Duvall, Brando and Cazale run him very close.  The three scenes I love more than ever are Michael's revenge in the restaurant (greatest scene of all time!), when Michael realises from the panic in his bodyguard's face as he runs off that Apollonia is in danger and when Sonny beats up Calo and finishes him in the gutter.  Superb from start to finish."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nuitsilencieux,10,7 July 2008,"When Francis Ford Coppola is on, he is absolutely on. The Godfather, in all of its noirish glory, is brilliant in virtually every respect. It's hard to criticize it, so I'll just honor it some more."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ormessi,9,12 July 2013,"A GREAT MOVIE, one of the best film art ever, the actors are great especially Al Pacino that made there(in my opinion) his best performance of his career. this movie takes you inside the Italian mafia world in the US but more important, it takes you inside the Corleone family, it shows the the relationship between the father, Don Vito and his children, especially with Michael(Al Pacino). What makes this movie so fascinating is the way that Francis Ford Coppola(the director) make you to identify with the main characters - people who murder their enemies and live like they are above the law, he make you love and admire the bad guys - The Mafia. In conclusion, the godfather is one of the best movies I have ever seen and i recommend it to all the film lovers. for anothe reviews: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur44998795/?ref_=nb_usr_prof"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samupton,10,1 August 2006,i have only recently watched this film for the first time on TV. i didn't know what to expect i have herd great things from some people and not so great things from other people. i had previously never seen a AL Pacino film. then i watched what i believe to be the greatest film ever made and after looking at IMDb's top 250 list i realized a lot of other people loved it to. i loved it from start to finish i was immensely enthralled from beginning to end.this film has superb performances from all the cast. especially from AL Pacino who plays Michael coreleone the son of feared don Marlon Brando who dilverd another great performance. this film got me hooked on crime movies and on AL pacino who is know my favorite actor of all time and also the best. i wouldn't say every body will love this film it is slow to begin with and some people with no taste in film will say it is boring which absolutely incorrect. if you like films at all you have to see the godfather.

It is not perfect, but it still probably deserves the number one spot. It is definitely the best mob movie ever made, but I don't like how people live and die by it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),toysoldier_johnnybanks,1,26 September 2003,"I don't see what anybody saw in this movie, boring, and redundant. I was bored with the film, and it is a horrible attempt to make a good movie. If you have any taste what so ever you will turn down a crapfest like this and watch something respectful like Batman, or The Rookie, or heck even Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. In any event stay away from this waste of film. 0 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeremyw_90210,10,17 June 2005,"Anybody who denies the entire trilogy as being a cinematic masterpiece is not a fan of cinema. This is by far and will most likely be the best picutre of all time. It is a movie that contains some of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures. Marlon Brando had a stunning comeback as the result of this movie. Al Pacino also proved that he is truly one of the screens greatest actors and this movie reminds us why we love him so much. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Richard Constellano vividly brought their characters to life in a truly unforgettable film in the first film while Robert De Niro and Lee Strassberg did it in the second film. All in all this is the greatest trilogy of all time"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),smithmjsjsmith-614-318703,10,21 December 2009,"I'll admit the movie at first was very boring, but after watching again, I fell in love with it. A movie that is really flawless. Incredible Story (I WON'T REVEAL ANY OF IT), Great Directing, Very Intense and deep scenes throughout the film, great music, the stage is very well set (this takes place in the 1940s, it was filmed in 1972 and it was almost as if it was filmed in the 1940s). And the most important of all is the acting, THIS MOVIE HAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. To start, James Caan places as ""Sunny Corleone"", Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" (you may also know him from ""Apocalypse Now""), The Legendary Al Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"" puts up a hell of a show. And to top of it all was perhaps the Greatest Actor of All Time behind Humphrey Bogart: Marlon Brando as ""Vito Corleone"" Brando was the old actor, but still put up a great show starting a franchise that became one of the greatest films of all time. The film won Best Picture (despite being an R rated film), and Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Lead Role. I'd probably start a debate just saying it's the greatest film of all time, but I'm going to do it anyway, THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME, everything is perfect in this film. You are not educated in Filmographically if you haven't seen this movie. If this movie didn't exist, the movies nowadays would be 100% different than what they are now. Period."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tomgillespie2002,10,12 December 2013,"Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don't know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone's husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it's a miracle it's managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It's also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola's head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it's just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Troll_Patrol101,10,24 September 2009,"''The Godfather'' is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aggaurav67,10,13 October 2008,"One realizes the importance of movies after watching this movie.Though paced slow , yet misses nothing. The movie tells the story not just of a mafioso but also of one of the strongest and most stable characters created -The GODFATHER. One of the most remarkable part of the movie is Al Pacino's acting. In the beginning he is a very cute person and you don't see any vice in him.Now, when things go bad for him ,you see him changing ,his eyes becoming dangerous.By the end of the movie he is entirely somebody else -The next GODFATHER. The theme music has a touch of negativity in it to depict the dark side of the Godfather but the Sicilian part has very soothing music also. The only drawback(if at all it is) is the pace of the movie which might seem slow compared to these days movie with so many cuts and pacing music,but if you have the patience to watch it, only then will you realize how great the movie is."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sparky-76,,11 October 2003,"I got a laugh from the people who found this film to be unoriginal, lukewarm, or not up to the standards of other mob films or tv shows.  ""The Godfather"" is the grand daddy of them all! Coppola and Puzo practically invented the genre of ""mafiosi as Shakespeare"".  Given how subsequent films and tv shows have run with these themes (even done them to death) most of what you're left with in this film is acting and craftsmanship.  But man o man.  It doesn't get better.  ""Shawshenk Redemption"", in contrast, was a good installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MovieCritic20497,7,20 May 2002,"This movie was not #1 of the top 250 worthy. It was not the greatest film of all time.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vito7,10,2 November 2008,"For my money the original Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. Compelling, legendary and timeless, with Marlon Brando coming out of retirement to blow the barn doors off the hinges with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, one of the most revered characters in movie history. He once again raises the bar on what a great actor can achieve and should be expected to. This movie began one of the most amazing movie careers in history with Al Pacino and also took America's guilty obsession with the ""ganster"" to new heights. It is a constant frustration for me when The Godfather II gets a higher rating then the predecessor. Also an all time great but there is likely no movie that deserves higher praise then this original ground-breaker. It has set a level of excellence for crime dramas that every movie since only strives to reach. The number of referenced and quoted scenes in modern Americana is matched only by Casablanca and thirty five years later it has still not faded in the memories of its audience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kushal2091,10,27 June 2008,"First of all this Movie contains a message and that is 'If you have the power use it your way'. An in the movie the director followed it perfectly. His work should be applauded What a movie!!! This is basically a movie on gangsters! and this has everything in the life on a don 'The Godfather'. This movie obviously deserves 10! Acotrs acted brilliantly, Story was brilliant, direction was awesome, It's just perfect! 'The Godfather' has everything to call it 'The Godfather' it has emotions, action, real life, romance everything is perfect in it! I am not amazed with the fact that it's no.1 in the world it should be! And by the way a film which which is this real should be no.1! The film has answered everything about a don's questions!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kewell-19,,25 April 2014,"The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972. It earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in North America during its initial release,[30] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[31] and including a limited re-release in 1997 it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million.[2] It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[32][33] News articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[32] but such accounts are erroneous since this record in fact belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[34] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[35] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount Pictures, jumped from seventy-seven cents per share to three dollars and thirty cents a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[32] To date, it has grossed between $245 million and $286 million in worldwide box office receipts,[36] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest- grossing films"

America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Chris_Docker,9,23 December 2006,"Taking the old-fashioned gangster film to new heights, The Godfather used traditional story-telling freed from the strict censorship that meant bad guys always got their come-uppance. More film noir than thriller, there are no good guys, and we meditate on the small rays of hope within the darkness of corruption, or wonder how far our good and pleasant lifestyles are supported, at some level, by corruption."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),coolcookyuk,9,4 August 2006,"IT was good for its time yeah sure but do you really still think it deserves #1 of ALL TIME!!?? I just think there are better films out there ones with more action, suspense,special effects ( i know it was low budget),actors etc. There just seemed to be more dialogue than anything else in the film put together. If you showed this to the younger generation then they would simply not be impressed. There are bigger titles out now and why is everyone still voting this in? It would be much better to vote the lord of the rings trilogy in the top 3 or put the shaw shank redemption at #1 that would make more sense. I would personally put ""The Godfather"" at #5 seeing as it does have the best title for a film of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DKosty123,10,20 November 2006,"The Cordleone family is modeled on a Mafia family which existed. The Mario Puzo novel was highly fictionalized & made for an interesting premise. The classic line from this film ""I'm going to make them an offer they can't refuse,"" has become the most cliché line ever uttered from a film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Horst_In_Translation,8,23 June 2019,"""The Godfather"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1972, so this one is already almost 50 years old now, 3 to go, and it runs for almost three hours. I am not even sure if it is necessary to talk about the basics here, but lets go. The director is Francis Ford Coppola and he is also part of the writing team. This is probably still the defining mafia movie and the rating here on imdb says it all. It won Best Picture at the Oscars and Marlon Brando (in heavy makeup) received the second Oscar of his career. Add to that a writing Oscar, but the movie was cut short because of the tremendous success of Cabaret at the Oscars this year where Fosse won Director over Coppola and Grey beat all the three supporting nominees from The Godfather. I don't think Pacino was in the right category though, but I guess they really were all over Brando and wanted to make sure that nobody (from his own film) could stop him from winning. Anyway, the film starts with Brando and he is certainly defining in the first 90 minutes of the movie until an assassination attempt happens and from that moment on he moves a bit into the background and the boys take over, most of all Pacino for whom it was really a star-making performance."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ColinHead,8,4 August 2002,"I have heard the huge uproar about how great this movie is and I was looking forward to seeing it.  I had high expectations so I don't know how that affected my opinion, but I think the movie was a complete waste of my time. I had seen Road to Perdition not even a month before it and consider that movie to be far superior in an intellectual standpoint, considering the magnetic performances of Tom Hanks and Jude Law.  The only somewhat decent acting in The Godfather was done by Al Pacino and Sophie Coppola.  I almost fell asleep watching this thing. I do not understand why it is such a classic.  It was a waste of my three dollars to even rent it!"

Well it turned out to be nothing more then the most boring piece of flying poop I've seen in my life. The acting is mediocre at best and the pace of the movie never changes, its just slow slow slow. Jesus Christ, I really couldn't care if all of the actors died in the movie since I had absolutely no interest in it. The movie too me was so boring and bland that It took me over a week to watch it since its pace is incredibly slow and it never changes. The best part of the movie was when it showed the credits and ended, I said to my self ""Thank god this fail is over"" Quote on quote. Anyways to sum it up don't watch this over rated piece of icky buffalo poop that a skunk died on if you know what a good movie is."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ericolsen1953,7,18 November 2007,"Very few movie dads come off worse than Vito Corleone. As he postures and pretends to be a man of honor and a man who loves his family, he's all the time setting in motion the elements that will wound or destroy his kids. No man is in the Mafia unless he's just a greedy SOB. So, Don Corleone mortgages his children's future at a very high interest rate in order to become a multimillionaire off of bootlegging, labor-union corruption, gambling and loan-sharking. One son is horribly murdered by a thousand bullets, his only daughter, Connie, is eventually left an embittered and tragic widow before she turns 25, his grandson by Connie is left orphaned thanks to in-house vengeance, his eldest son is corrupted and eventually under the mob thumb in Vegas and his idealistic youngest boy is overwhelmed by the old Mafia game and eventually seizes headship of The Commission by committing one of the worst mass-murders in New York history. Don Vito said in the third scene of this movie, ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man."" He should have focused on demonstrating values to his family, not just spending all that time with them."

Marlon Brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront, A streetcar named desire, and don Juan Marco just to name a few. Pacino wasn't even that good. i much preferred him in Carlitos way and Donnie bras-co and who could forget Scarface. Pacino is getting typecast. i think the only reason he did Simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal. i have to say i can't blame him.

The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),luke-isherwood,10,8 October 2009,"I will keep my review to a minimum as so much has been written on this film. It is a fantastic film (up there with Once Upon a Time in the West as one of the greatest of all). I watched it again for the 8th time after not seeing it for 5 years or so, and had forgotten just how immersive the film is. My only negative comment, and I add this as I haven't heard this criticism before, is that this is one of the few films that would benefit from being a little longer. At times the film cuts between scenes too quickly and speeds through threads looking almost cartoony, which is at odds with the general mood of the film of a slow relaxed immersive experience. In particular consider when Tom visits Hollywood to get Johnny Fontane a role. The sequence seems almost rushed as one minute Tom is in NY then LA and then cut, cut, cut suddenly there's a horse's head.. This happens a number of times in the film and probably resulted from studio pressure to reduce the film's running length. Overall though a masterpiece."

Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again."

Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie."

How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered.

I cant believe how young the lead players were! Brando looked older then however, necessary for proper plot development and atmosphere. I finally understood the manouvering that happens related to the criminal wars that take place twice during the film, once when don corleone has an attempt on his life and then again as michael asserts his influence."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),druryd,7,10 March 2002,"I just recently viewed the Godfather and while I find it an enjoyable movie, there is no way it deserves the #1 rank in the top 250 movies of all time. The plot is not that involved and the movie is a bit to long and drags in several scenes.  I found myself wondering when it was going to end and that is not the sign of a great movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeffhits,5,19 August 2023,"Honestly this movie is quite mid, its not bad but also not this ""best movie of all time ever"" that people say it is, my conclusion for that is that people just regurgitate what they've heard their nostalgic parents say to seem mature or intelligent.. The pacing in the movie itself is quite stagnant and unengaging after the first thirty or fourty minutes (and this movie goes on for 2 more hours)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sportsfansd,10,15 July 2008,"The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. Everything about the film is masterful and legendary. The cast is as good as any movie. Marlon Brando (In my opinion, the greatest actor of all time) plays the role of Don Vito perfectly. Al Pacino is amazing as Michael (should have won the Oscar for supporting actor) and the other supporting actors are fantastic. James Caan was the perfect choice for Sonny, Diane Keaton is great as Kay, DuVall acted marvelously as Tom Hagen and Cazalle is great as Fredo. The plot is masterful. There isn't one scene in the movie that doesn't have importance to the plot and there are several memorable quotes. (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"") Finally, the music by Nina Rota is superb. It fits perfect with the film and is in my opinion one of the greatest movie scores of all time. There isn't one weakness in the entire movie and there is't one single thing I would change about the movie. Finally, the ending is great with Micheal killing the heads of the five families, killing Tessio after finding out he was betraying him and Carlo because he set up the death of Sonny. A true legend."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thinker1691,9,30 November 2008,"The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called ""The Godfather"" about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as ""I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse."" A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Thanos_Alfie,10,11 August 2013,"One of the classic movies and one of my favorites movie of all time is ""The Godfather"". It is a movie that show us how are the things in mafia from an inside look. In this movie you will understand how things work in mafia and which is the followed hierarchy. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RohitRajkumar,10,14 August 2009,"I had heard a lot about this epic masterpiece for so many years and so I tried to get a DVD copy or catch a T.V premiere or any possible way.Finally,the wait was over.And to my surprise it was worth the wait"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Geeky Randy,10,17 March 2015,"Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PeterMitchell-506-564364,10,2 April 2013,"What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes ""Never personal"". He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering ""Yes"", would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it's ilk, better's it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),disdressed12,10,10 April 2010,"much has been said about how great this film is,and i hesitated for the longest time before breaking down,but finally i bought the Restoration Box set which contains the three films and two bonus discs.so,after watching this first film,i must say i was pretty impressed.it's a well crafted film.at a running time of just over one hundred and seventy three minutes,you'd never know it.there never a dull moment.it's exceptionally engrossing from the opening frame to the closing credits.the acting is superb.Marlon Brandon is excellent,but i would say that a young Al Pacino matches him.the dialogue is also well written.for me,The Godfather is a 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Steffi_P,10,22 July 2010,"There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dr_Sagan,,23 October 2014,"Although many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, the way Coppola presented the Corleone family , and his portrayal of mobsters as characters of considerable psychological depth and complexity was something new."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jay4stein79-1,7,16 November 2004,"During the 1970s, American directors decided, like their French counterparts did in the previous decade, to elevate and transcend the genres that appealed to them as children growing up in the 1940s and50s. Lucas took Buck Rodgers and Science Fiction to new levels, as didSpielberg with the Action/Adventure movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),g61268-1,2,1 April 2019,"I find it troubling that this is apparently a popular movie. The characters are all bad people - immoral, completely lost. Are we supposed to like them? I'm shaking my head thinking about it. It's also pretty slow. Lots of slow, quiet talk punctuated by random violence. If this is your sort of thing, well . . seek help. At least it's not propaganda like a Disney movie, or most Hollywood movies today for that matter."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),redryan64,10,12 February 2009,"MOTION PICTURES having organized crime as the subject matter seem to be forever ""IN"" as fair game for a movie (""Film' if it's a special, 'Top-Shelf'production). In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GOWBTW,10,23 May 2006,"A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where ""The Turk""(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Eliks,10,6 July 2005,"Yes yes, this movie is a fundamental classic, an epic piece, a masterstroke from Coppolla, Brando, Pacino, etc. But is it really the best movie ever? Well, that's how I interpret the fact it has been on the top of IMDb since I've looked in here for the first time. What makes it so flawless, what contributes to its eternal shining, blah blah. Maybe it's high time for a change, I'm sure a lot of cult classics have been released since The Godfather has been released. Oh well..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imran_ashraf,8,6 October 2000,"I was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created, it was no.1 in the IMDB chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted £12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours!! if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre !!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jacques98,10,3 March 2009,"There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of ""BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME"". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions—Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others—but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Brawl_666,9,18 October 2009,"My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that ""you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film."" At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),StanleyStrangelove,10,2 September 2005,Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece tells the saga of the Corleone family. Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of one of the five mafia families. With his son Sonny (James Caan) and lawyer/adviser Tom (Robert Duvall) he runs the family. But the heads of the other families see the Don as too powerful and out of date with the times. They want to get into drug trafficking and the Don wants none of that. Enter Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as the Don's other son who has returned from the military. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rajatdahiyax,10,21 August 2014,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug- trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisers Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),michelle-woods,,18 October 2006,"This is perhaps my favorite film of all time. No other picture of its kind is even comparable. It's such a great film that I almost find it difficult to write about. From the cast to the cinematography to the music, this movie leaves you absolutely mesmerized throughout."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jose-cruz53,10,13 October 2012,I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lambiepie-2,10,2 July 2003,"When you think of the top 25 films of all time, they have one thing in common. You could have seen them when they first came out or your children's children can be viewing them, and they will still give the same long lasting impression. They may encourage you/your children to get into film or entertainment, they make you think. They keep you talking well after you've seen the film not once, not twice, but for a long time. There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JoeHumfrey,10,18 June 2014,The Godfather is quite simply the best film of all time. The film really sets of the groundbreaking genre of mafia/gangster films. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),msff-04271,10,24 July 2020,"The Godfather is not only one of the best and most memorable movies, but also one of the most beautiful movies in history.
The film, which is not only full of power struggles and betrayals, but also shows a family that is always behind each other.
A father who, while being the biggest criminal in the city, loves his children so much that he is ready to kill the whole city by losing one of them, but for the sake of the other children, he forgives his son and finally dies playing with his grandson.
And of course, in the end, his little boy takes revenge on the whole family in the best possible way and becomes the first power again.
You know, the godfather is a combination of blood and love.
And if we want to describe it in one sentence, we can only say:
THE MOST PERFECT MOVIE EVER"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aniku_matador,10,11 July 2013,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."

The director, writers, actors & everyone else who had a part in making this movie are genius's. I think Godfather will be a classic 100 years from now. I just called 4 people & asked my husband the same question. ..""What are the top 3 best mob or gangster movies of all time? "" They ALL said Godfather & Scarface. 2 said Good fellows too. So it's not just my opinion. A lot of people know that this movie was one of the best movies ever! I may not be a movie critic or an actor, my daughter is an actor though & I know that ever since she has been acting, I actually pay attention to if someone really is a good actor or not & Godfather is full of awesome actors. After sitting in on many acting classes with my daughter I can tell a great actor! Thank you for making such a classic movie that will never get old. No matter how many times you watch it, it never gets old."

To me(and a lot of people), it was just a regular gangster movie, nothing more."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Alpik79,5,15 May 2012,I have recently watched Godfather again and my initial opinion did not change. There is a story but characters are superciliously described. In some cases they do not relate to the story completely. The competition among rival gangsters should have been better described to the audience.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thesouthfamily2-552-707097,10,3 January 2014,"Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can understand just by the way the characters look at each other and talk to each other. Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity. So much so that ""The Godfather"" (played brilliantly by Marlon Brando) himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprise. Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. What else can I say about this movie that no one else has said: it's a classic and for good reason."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sfpsycho415,9,3 August 2003,"It is no wonder The Godafather is often regarded as the best film ever. It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent. In my opinion Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever, but this pulls in an ultra close second. 9/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sam_smithreview,10,28 April 2016,"""The Godfather"" is flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. This is the best role Al Pacino ever played, and he didn't win best actor. The only negative thing i could say i have against the film. Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940's, in this well- respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SmileysWorld,8,18 December 2013,"It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece."

Pretty good. 10/10. Good ligthning. Great characters. Great original soundtrack. Great story. Great domestic violence. No this hasn't been a review yet. here it comes. The movie start out very promising and what makes it so great is that it continues having that great promise in mind and deliver it with such great impact. Like it's kinda like 5th impact in Neon Genesis Evangelion there never was a 4th but it jumps over the 4th and gets to the 5th right away like a great movie should. 10/10 avocado.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Det_McNulty,10,14 August 2007,"The majority of critics will cite the definitive ""greatest film of all-time"" as Citizen Kane, but other films are regularly mentioned in conjunction, one of those being The Godfather. Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called ""gangster flicks"", most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),long-ford,,27 February 2009,"'The Godfather' remains compelling viewing after all these years. Directed masterfully by Francis Ford Coppola, the film shows the control of a mafia family passing from Marlon Brando to his reluctant son Al Pacino. The opening segment is brilliant as it introduces all the main characters. The acting is superb across the board with Brando winning a richly deserved Best Actor Oscar for his highly nuanced portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. Pacino gives an understated performance with sudden intense outbursts. The film is very violent but remains hugely influential. One of the all time greats."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marcosmarino,7,27 August 2002,"No doubt a good movie, but to place it among the top ten is foolish. It hasn't introduced anything new at any cinematic level. Its influence on the living trends of cinema is practically zero (no interesting movie made after The Godfather owes anything to it). It's the paradigmatic example of what Fredric Jameson calls nostalgia cinema, a pastiche of the old conventions of gangster movies, a kind of funerary monument. Classical cinema ended long time ago (probably in the fifties), and this movie is just a well-done late survivor, a kind of aesthetic dinosaur."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),paulclaassen,3,8 August 2023,"And so I finally decided to watch the second highest rated movie of all time.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),diogo461,9,11 October 2015,"This movie is awesome in every detail . The actors make the best movie ever. The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando."

Since the film also has stay the phrase had said Don «I'm going to make him an offer he can not refuse »(I'll make an offer that can not be refuse), which was voted as the second most memorable phrase in the history of cinema. Very nice Cast! Thank you! The Godfather is a 1972 film based on the homonym book Mario Puja."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),petriani,10,11 August 2006,"I have watched this movie twice in my life. The first time maybe I was too young to understand, however capable of grasping the tension of Brando's and Pacino's outstanding performances..Complexion and variety of feelings and emotions were all over the place...Simplicity is I believe what great performances are all about..A slight move of the hand(like the one that Brando touches his cheek at the first scene or the look at Pacino's eyes in the scene of the baptismal while on the same time resetting his empire)..One of the greatest Greek actors, Dimitris Horn, said that ""Actor means internal light"", and in this film we found a -two- truly great example(s) of Horn's quotation.....The second time I was to see how contemporary a film ""The Godfather"" also was- what we could call classical...Vito Copleone's character could , quite ironical and strangely, set an example to the modern rulers of the world, with the 'dignity' with which he faces his enemies and 'runs his business'... on the same time, through the lovely portrayal of the family life of the Corleones, Francis Ford Coppola, I believe , manages to comment on the sadness and tragedy that lye underneath every,ostensibly, ordinary life...The best part of this extraordinary film is I believe the way Mickle Corleone descends into his personal Adis, as (personaly) I cannot make out whether his choices are affected by the duty he feels he owns to his beloved father or from his own nature- intrigued by adventure, power and hate...The best thing I believe is that I'll never understand.American is used to explain everything to its viewers. This time it would be unnecessary...People(Americans, Europeans????) still need to have the chance to choose whether 'evil' derives from the circumstances(which gives hope) or it is just an unbeatable part of human nature........"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Andre_Dos_Santos,10,25 October 2018,"Best movie ever made, by far my favorite movie.

Nothing mentioning the song track , AMAZING ,expecially the wedding scene."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Littlephil1,10,21 November 2014,"The story begins as ""Don"" Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia ""family"", oversees his daughter's wedding with his wife Carmela. His beloved son Michael has just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his father's business. Through Michael's life the nature of the family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of the family. Don Vito lives his life in the way of the old country, but times are changing and some don't want to follow the old ways and look out for community and ""family"". An up and coming rival of the Corleone family wants to start selling drugs in New York, and needs the Don's influence to further his plan. The clash of the Don's fading old world values and the new ways will demand a terrible price, especially from Michael, all for the sake of the family. - Written by Charlie Ness"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ercandogane-1,10,29 June 2014,"The Godfather is a 1972 masterpiece. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, and stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The story of the movie takes place from 1945 to 1955. It the best movie about the Mafia. In addition, many have called it the best movie of all time. A sequel, The Godfather Part II, was released in 1974 and won another Best Picture Oscar, too. It was the only sequel to do so until 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third movie in the Godfather trilogy, The Godfather Part III, came out in 1990. I think it was not as good as the other two movies. Even though if we think the trilogy as one movie, it is the greatest work of the seventh art, I think."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stevenmaffei,,28 October 1999,"This film is by far and away the best ""mafia"" movie in history.  It makes you root for the ""bad guy"" and sympathize with him.  The acting is superb on all accounts.  After this movie, most of the actors became famous beyond belief.  It is a must see, and that means more than once.  Every time I watch this film, I find new things hidden that you would not see the first time around.  Nothing compares to the story line of this film.  The length of the film is well worth it.  You are not bored for one second.  Go watch the film, be awe struck, and write a review like the rest of us.  It is not ranked number 1 for nothing."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Andres-Camara,5,30 November 2016,"This is one of the mythical films in the history of cinema. As well as Taxi driver, I think it is overrated. If it is true that the film has an impressive setting. That the actors are very well. The problem is that it does not catch me. He can not hook me. When it seems that it is going to put interesting Al Pacino goes away of trip and does things that do not make sense and that do not come to story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrbatur,9,30 August 2020,Nice Movie! I love this film so much. The Godfather is the best series i have ever seen.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shepardjessica-1,10,31 December 2004,"Francis Coppola's best film that deserved more than it's 3 Oscars (especially with CABARET winning 8 that year). James Caan is feisty, belligerent and passionate as Sonny, Al Pacino is introspective and brooding as young Michael, John Cazale is awkward and insecure as Fredo, Robert Duvall in quietly intelligent,and Brando kicks butt in one of his finest characters. A wonderful supporting cast, especially Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire and Richard Castellano."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aminsuwedi,10,1 June 2014,"Well, there is pretty little to say about the bad side of the film, but about the good ones a lot can be said. The story was amazing, ahead from most of its time. The pacing was also incredible, one that wouldn't put you through boredom. I think as a film student, the film should be used as a study case for those who would like to write stories that could be translated into films. The actors were good as well especially the main character; one would have to watch to understand. How the dialog is held and how it translates to the character of the individuals in the film. The cinematography was fantastic; well I look up to be one so in short there use of color, shots, light is what makes the story even more interesting. I love the depth of their blacks and how they use the warm tones to convey some emotions and moods in the film. In short the film should be used widely in film schools for multiple purposes in the film industry."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),third_t-bone,9,29 July 2020,"The Godfather is not a perfect film. It is similar to the original Star Wars in that while it's flawed, its originality and cultural impact cannot be overlooked."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dalaleyburak-1,10,19 December 2006,"People can tell lots of things about this movie, but this movie teaches something that nobody doesn't notice really. It is about being a man. What is being a man? First, it is loving your family and depend on them. You always protect them from every dangerous situation, and it doesn't matter how to do. You can do it legally or illegally. Second thing is always being calm and strong-minded. If you are calm and strong-minded, you will be able to protect your family. This movie teaches people it. You must watch this movie if you never watched it before. If you watched it before, you must watch it again and again, so you can understand the thought of this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jarrysimon,8,26 March 2015,"Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I don't care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn't change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. "

Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wds-3,1,17 November 1999,"What can I say?  I gave this thing a 1 because I honestly have never felt it was all that good.  I that saw the average was a 9  at the time I voted and I felt the dissenters should get some representation.  Brando isn't all that great in it.  I mean the thing is better than the average film (at least I'm supposed to believe that), but 9 out of 10!?  No way.  Watch different movies.  In fact, watch other coppala movies.  I personally like 'The Outsiders' and 'The Conversation' better.  I find the story to be boring. I also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish.  I won't go into detail on this.  I will just say the thing left me dry."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abdulrahmanalassil,10,13 September 2015,"This is my number one movie. It is the best mafia movie. It is the best movie of AL Pacino. I heard that the director put a real horse head, and the actor did not knew that, so his reaction was real. You can feel the power throw the head of the family ""the godfather himself""."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scorpion_fz,9,22 July 2014,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),What92691,10,23 May 2003,"The Godfather is the best movie ever, also the best adaptation from a book, Francis Ford Coppola did a great job on knowing what to put in, and what to put out. I would like to point out that characters in the book have the last names of some of the people part of the movie, Anthony Coppola is one character obviously the relation is with Francis Ford Coppola, I forgot the first name but there was a Mancini as one character, the relation is the guy who did the them song's name is Henry Mancini. Also the producer did a great job of picking all Italian people, I heard somewhere that they almost picked Robert Redford for the job as Michael Corleone, somewhere on television, once I heard this I new it was one of the worst picks ever, I don't know how the producer could've picked that but the rest of the cast is tremendous. This is also great because nobody thought of the mafia underworld idea until Mario Puzo came out with the book, nobody knew how to make the book into the movie, and some people didn't think of making the book into the movie. A lot of people say the second one is better than the first, I would say no on that, because there's nothing better than the oringinal, the second one was excellent, but not as good as the first because it was as entertaining as the first, the things that almost bored me was the family situations, family crisis, not a lot of action, and shooting. In the first one the kills were more out of no where, and surprising me, like when the man went to take a leak, and on the way back the guy killed the guy, a brilliant set up. This movie is tremendous and wonder why would anybody give it a one, because I saw on the voting charts there was a 1.6, for the ones, maybe they don't recognize the excellence, and art of this movie, but I would like to say the movie is brilliant, I gave it a 10, and I hope you do to."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kalupetrovic,10,4 January 2019,Amazing character development. Sound was carefully woven into every scene. One word: masterpiece.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LAVERYBUGSY,10,5 March 2002,I know everybody says the same thing but this truly is a masterpiece. There are so many truths in the film to real gansterism. like the raspy voice of don Vito is like that of Frank Costello's voice. The wedding at the start of the film is like the Bill Bonanno wedding and even the plot to kill the heads of the five main families at the end of thefilm is taken from Joe Bonanno so i think Mario Puzo knew a lot more about the mob than maybe we all first thought. But still an outstanding piece of film and the book is superb as well.

I could never get tired of watching this movie! This movie makes you feel like you're part of that world. Francis Ford Coppola will always be considered one of the best auteur's in cinema! Al Pacino and especially Marlon Brando are superb! The score of the film is legendary. And, How Marlon Brando delivers his lines is just chilling of how amazing it is. I seriously, which that movies can be this good in our day and age! Movies are not like this anymore and movies these days are about franchise and blockbuster hits. Sad, how Hollywood thinks about money, it's show business, and key word ""business."" But, THE GODFATHER, is true cinema!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emesgi,10,24 January 2007,It's the best movie i have seen in my entire acting carrer. Marlon Brando is indeed the best choice for the role of the Godfather.It's a shame dough he dies in the end.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jeremy_Urquhart,10,7 May 2020,"The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the ""my opinion"" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I ""appreciate"" whilst not particularly ""enjoying."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnvanpelt,10,28 December 2006,"What a movie, the godfather of all movies for ever!! I love this movie, the plot, the actors, everything. Al Pacino as a young boy starting to take his fathers place. The Italian customs, the cast. From the beginning tot the end: truly fantastic! I see this movie every year and it keeps getting better. Suspense, Humor, Action, Great Characters and so on. Greatest movie ever made! Of course the movie is part 1, part 2 and part 3. But I must say part 1 is my favorite part. Swichting form Sicily to America is brilliant. With my friends we recently had an Italian night, with Italian food and wines. Watching this movie we make jokes and start imitating the characters: ""act like a man!"" Hehe, great!"

If you saw the movie, try and book of the same title by Mario Puzzo ... simply help visual memory to ""see"" the characters ... the book is very good and worth reading after you see the movie. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie. In the second part of the movie was pretty broken thread by death character Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino seemed too young for the part."

This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance.

When you're watching you feel like you're one of the members in the family. Marlon Brando's quiet and confident mafia boss character is impressive. The soundtrack of the movie is delightful.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),soyelamodelmundo,10,6 April 2014,"Probably the greatest film of all times. This film is, in my opinion, absolutely perfect: Coppola's best direction, fantastic photography, perfectly acted by all the cast, thrilling story..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jevaptpm,10,27 March 2014,"This should always be on top, The movie is classy stuff, Don Corleone is the best, And you will surely remember his quotes after the movie is over, Later on al pacino catches up in great pace I have seen all 3 part and i believe this is the best Of all. God Father "" I will make him a deal he cannot reject"" To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salvatoresilvestrino,10,8 December 2019,"Without a doubt, it is the most cinematic triumph of its' kind...the narrative goes beyond the lens, it delivers an all star performance from the gritty dark family crimes of the early 40's .......
The performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro and others were superb.
Let's not forget some of the best lines from any film that every Italian / Italo-American and Gangster lovers still to this day pronounce them with the garb and audacity to catch a laugh.... LEAVE THE GUN, TAKE THE CANNOLI...
The Godfather, the ultimate Mafia Movie...."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ChiefBrody75,9,10 March 2006,"It's not my personal #1 movie of all time, but after finally watching it I can understand why it's usually regarded as the greatest by so many. It can seem a little dated at times, but for a film that is over thirty years old it still stands up. Slow and deliberate, the movie shows that if you have an attention span of longer than 30 seconds you don't have to have action in every scene. Which is why when something does happen it is so shocking and unpredictable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),roland-27,,5 September 1999,"This is a visual epic with grand performances from the entire cast. Marlon Brando's ""Banana Mouth Trick"" is one of the most imitated characters in movie history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),link_nich,6,27 February 2008,"In other words it is not the greatest film of all time. I cannot stand people who have claimed it to be. It is no where as a good as Shawshank, Alien and definitely is not, and never will be, as good as Taxi Driver. It does have its moments and Al Pacino was brilliant, (no I'm not going to give Marlon Brando a shout out, because he too is overrated) the music is stunning and so is the story but it isn't very catching I had to space the viewing over a number of days because I couldn't be arsed watching all at once without felling the urge to watch something else. It rises well but then falls flat on to its face then slowly makes it to it's knees towards the end. Yet I still find it hard to believe how it is the 'best' film ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dwendllandson,1,12 May 2022,"I watched this movie two days ago, after seeing the rating which is quit remarkable but in the reality this movie sucks."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Berkobar,10,24 February 2017,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jonpaul-stone-895-772059,9,21 August 2014,"It goes without saying that this is a classic for the ages. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Mafia Godfather Don Corleone is one of the if not the best performance I have seen from an actor in a movie. When you add the young Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and so many other amazing supporting actors & Movie Magic truly happens. I felt like I was in New York at the height of the Sicilian/Italian Mafias reign the first time I saw The Godfather and am still captivated and entertained every time I watch this Movie. Mario Puzo is a wonderful writer and Francis Ford Coppola really knows what he is doing behind the camera this is the perfect storm a great movie making."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),flk-florin,10,18 June 2014,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael , Santino and Tom Hagen , his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates. he Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnnyboyz,8,10 March 2009,"Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joseph-18151,9,21 August 2023,"An absolute must see. Even if you aren't the crime movie type, the Godfather is a showcase of what amazing writing, great acting and a brilliant score can do when put together. The movie has captured a great feel for the time and left lasting impressions. The story and characters were more than enough to immerse you into this criminal world and keeps you glued to the screen and on the edge of you seat, waiting to see what comes next. It is a brilliant starting point in this trilogy/ The filming in terms of costumes and settings should not be overlooked as these things played a major part in it's beauty."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),daniel_cooper_dww,10,9 January 2002,"In many ways, this is less of a Hollywood film and more a Greek tragedy. The fall of our roguish hero, Michael Corleone, from hotshot son of a crumbling mafia dynasty, wishing to break free from his roots, going to College and then joing the Army."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cocaine_rodeo,9,8 July 2001,"This movie is questionably the best ever made. It's in my top five (at #4). #4 my seem a little high, but Scorsese slid into #1, #2, and #3."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jamtland1976,6,21 July 2003,"How this movie has to be #1 is a mystery, then I see that Lord of Rings is #5 and I understand. Just think people rated this movie #1 cause other did it. A kind of conformism. The story is completely non-sense. What's the deal in a mafia family's revenge? Good actors don't mean good movie, good director doesn't mean good movie. If the story lacks then direction and acting are worthless. This movie is BORING! There's no emotional scene in all movie, oh well if you except the horse in the bed. There's anyway some funny moments, as the way are pictured the mafia guys in Sicily, really outdated. Lol Make a favour to yourself, this movie is almost 3 hours long, add another hour and watch to ""Once upon a time in America"", a real epic tale on gangster. This Godfather was a big disappointment :("
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dean_paul,3,14 March 2006,"I watched this film because it had a high user rating. I don't get why people find it a good film. For me, it was just a film about people, a family, killing other people. I couldn't take much more away from it than that, sorry. Shawshank is a much better film in every respect. The Godfather is long and drawn out and although it is one of the better gangster films, I would have to say that it is not one that I will watch again. Please let there be someone that agrees with me. From the reviews that I have read there doesn't seem to be a good reason to suggest why this film is voted number one, something that really puzzles me. There are no twists, little to think about, and the film hardly makes you feeling better at the end of it, does it? I've seen much better films than the Godfather although I'm sure, as I seem to be going against popular opinion, I will get heavily criticized for these comments."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),C22Man,10,29 October 2013,"The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America/organised crime era like no other.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),irishfreedom2013,10,3 June 2014,"The Godfather (1972) was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who in 1970 directed the successful movie Patton. Although the Patton movie was successful, not even Coppola could have predicted the success that was produced by The Godfather. The movie was based on a novel by Mario Puzo, who along with Coppola wrote the screenplay. The lead role was played by Marlon Brando, and he was supported by great actors, such as Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert Duvall, and many others who put in amazon performances."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mcleanmuir,10,7 January 2019,Seen this film over 100 times. Everything about it is great. Saw it when it was first released and it's never faded or got weaker.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amirul19692000,9,31 August 2013,"A number of factors are just designed to end up being ideal, sleek as well as nicely, godly. This Godfather, through Francis Kia Coppola as well as Mario Puzo is actually. Just how all facets involving filmmaking as well as storytelling enhances the other within this unforgettable motion picture leads to that you ask yourself ( really) if such a task might be repeated, actually."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grahamsj3,10,2 February 2003,"BAR NONE! As of now, this film is the greatest film ever made. I'm sure something will eventually surpass it, but it'll really take a spectacular movie to do it. This film has it all - an extremely powerful, believable story, an all-star cast and a director (Francis Ford Coppola) who made the effort and took the time to do it right! The story is of a Mafia family in the 30's through the 60's and the events that catapult a son into control of the family's empire. Al Pacino, in particular, did a fantastic job as Michael Corleone, son of his father, although he didn't intend it to be that way. There is a lot of violence, but it's not there for violence's sake. The world of organized crime was much more violent in the past than it seems to be now and the violence is depicted as more or less just a part of doing business. This is perhaps Marlon Brando's greatest performance (as the father) ever. Other great actors include James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. This is one of the best-cast films I've ever seen. I intend to always own a copy of this film!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),semipro13,10,14 November 2014,"That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the ""Godfather"" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're cultural touchstones."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ganeshbarman-14454,6,1 March 2021,"I don't think this movie deserves 9.2. It is a boring family drama movie, no doubt the actors were one of the best but overall the movie is super bore and normal crime/drama movie. But again I'll say the cast was superb.
Just see shawshank redemption, it's a masterpiece and godfather just doesn't deserve to be so close to shawshank"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sykotikLP,1,5 May 2003,I dont see the big deal about this movie. I think it sucks. Everyone always talks about how good it is and that it's a classic
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jimmy_james777,8,25 August 2012,I LOVED IT! The movie was so long but had great suspense in it. The story line was ever flowing and the way the characters dealt with the situation was cleverly written and acted. I loved Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in this movie and it was a one of a kind movie that people of any nature can enjoy! So looking forward to part 2!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stefankgkg,10,20 October 2015,"What can you say about this movie?Greatest movie of all time,2 greatest actors working together.Would recommend to everyone.Even if you are not in mafia and killing i think you are going to enjoy watching it. Of course you have to watch second and third part also.In those two parts also awesome actors.You will see how people who came to America had hard life trying to make some money for their family so they can eat and enjoy a little in life.And you will see that family is really everything in life. Its based on true story and five mafia families running New York. Movie is long but you wont even notice when you are having such a great time watching it.I hope this review helped you guys."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lazcarez,10,10 March 2001,"I believe that ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece, an excellent movie which I have seen about 6 times. I have not gotten bored by watching it, thus I wait for a next opportunity to watch it again. The problem is that now I feels like a 90 minutes movie instead of a 171 minute film. But it's still great. I saw the three movies in one day, and let me tell you that the movie changed my life. My mind thought differently and I began to feel stronger, better self confidence. I'm not saying that I started to kill, but I can relate to this film. Probably I'm not the only Godfather fan with this feeling. I can confess that I've not read the book, but before I die I will read it. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it. It's worth it. I wish I were born before the movie came out so I could see it at a movie theater. I am waiting for the DVD version, and I hope it comes out soon. So I guess I will have to buy a DVD player!!! But for now I enjoy it in VHS digitally remastered. The acting is incredible, like if the actors were real, like if the Corleone Family really existed or does exist."

The Director he had know how to play with all the personalities and their roles. So great thank to him because he make a great movie. For the stars, ""Unkonwn"" he's my best actor all time ! 14 October 1994 is a special day, so always remember it ! :D I liked everything about the movie, even the Soundtracks.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),remusschiau,10,8 July 2013,"One of the best, if not the best Crime and Mob war movie ever made, including one of my favorite actor, Al Pacino. The whole series is awesome, full of action and drama. 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adam-moore1308,8,29 December 2013,"This film is often regarded as perfect including the acting which is renowned as some of the best in the history of cinema. However I was quite underwhelmed by the performances except for Marlon Brando who is truly captivating whenever he is on screen (which is surprisingly not that often considering he won best LEAD actor for his performance.) Even Al Pacino's performance is both emotionless and forgettable in my opinion. I'm not going to waste time talking about everything that makes this film good because everyone has done that. What I am going to do is just mention some of the reasons why, overall, I was disappointed in the film. My first problem with the film is that I often found the story stretched thin by too many characters and occasionally found myself confused by the many unfamiliar Italian names that kept popping up. The first two hours of the film are exceptionally entertaining, well made and expertly written. However it is around the two hour mark where what was making the story so captivating is almost completely resolved and we are then forced to sit through another hour of a film that is no longer all that interesting. The three hour run time of the film is certainly unnecessary as even though seeing Michael take over the reigns of the family and watching Vito die is still great stuff it feels like it could have been covered in 15 minutes instead of adding another hour to a film that felt like it had already ended. I do understand that my opinion will not be popular but I felt that I should mention my problems with the film and stop some people being brainwashed by its 9.2 IMDb rating and then instantly saying that its a masterpiece so they could be accepted even though they may have found parts of it boring. I don't know... Perhaps my expectations were too high."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mukherjeesubham93,10,23 May 2015,"Francis ford Coppola's 'Godfather'....this along with its 1974 sequel is movies at its very best.....this is a near perfect movie...I know this has been said a number of times by a lot of people but for once I feel most of them are right. There are a lot of memorable scenes which stay with you long after you have seen it...and I think that is the reason why this is probably the best movie on organized crime, because it haunts you long after you have seen it. Marlon Brando as don Vito corleone is excellent, for which he well deservingly received an Oscar. Al pacino's Michael corleone for me is the most memorable character in the whole of film history, both cold blooded ruthless villain and a tragic hero at the same time, pacino mostly emotes through those eyes of his and his subtle, measured yet explosive performance is responsible for why people keep going back to godfather and try and interpret and justify each of his character's nuances...separate mention for the memorable sequences which Coppola designs...the sepia toned photography and nino rota's hauntingly beautiful score. After mentioning so much, I still remain doubt what makes this movie so great and arguably the greatest motion picture of all time...I guess that is the way with iconic movies...you never know what's the best thing in it yet you keep going back to it again and again...like an offer you can't refuse!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dwpeak,10,19 January 2007,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" will remain an icon in movie history forever. It gives the audience what few films ever have; flawless and poetic storytelling. The script by Mario Puzo and Coppola (based on Puzo's masterful novel) is beat-by-beat perfect. It is also a study in the form of directing at its best. The legendary performances hold nothing back. It is the kind of movie that film students should be required to watch, because it is one of the few examples of flawless film-making in world history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dean keaton,10,18 February 2000,"It will not take very long: The Godfather is just...THE MOVIE. It's not my favorite movie, it's not the funniest movie I've ever seen or that of which I remember the dialogues as if I had studied them, but there's no single movie since 1972 (and maybe before) that hasn't taken something of it. It's poetry in motion, it's tender, wild, violent...again, it's THE MOVIE."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tahmeedkc,10,5 June 2014,"The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FlickJunkie-2,10,8 September 2000,"Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top 100), `The Godfather' brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DJAlejandros,1,10 April 2002,"When a prestige movie is made, utmost attention is given to detail, grandeur, style, and above all, popularity.  Godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of Mario Puzo, who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster/mobster.  Capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable: to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls, and that they are certainly not invincible.  This movie was what it was meant to be, a prestige movie, it took very few risks, and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters."

The movie starts with an astounding performance of a guy who later is magnified with few events/dialogues and gets introduced to us as a Gangster/Don/GodFather, although the movie feels more dramatic with a whole lot of family/dramatic scenes, it never keeps us unengaged and later when the unexpected hierarchy of kid gets to pick up the left overs by the big guy with a parallel eventful formation of a new don built upon the legacy of it as the climax forms the crux for its series as a whole."

In this first part you see how a crime family runs their business and how the head of the crime family have to deal with lots of complications with other crime family's in new york, with the police, with his sons and daughter. Marlon Brando plays a very dark head of the crime family. Together with Al Pacino James Caan and Robert Duvall who also play awesome, Its a must to see if you like crime movies. If you ain't see this movie, you ain't see any other movie. Also the music in the movie is really well chosen, it has something scary and at the same time it feels like heaven. Just watch it. cant tell what happens in the movie, because then i have to make a review of 2000 pages i think."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dlee7674,10,28 January 2008,"Ever since i watched this movie i have loved it, every detail of the movie keeps me intrigued. Its sad in todays society that many people cant sit through such an amazing movie because they get bored so easily. Everyone needs to be constantly entertained, if you are a person like that you shouldn't watch this movie. If you love movies and have a fine appreciation for it you will find this to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting is brilliant, the music keeps you dazzled and the drama keeps you into the movie the whole way through. After i saw this movie i had to see every Al Pacino film and i think this may have been his best performance of his career, and Francis Ford Copla set a standard with movie making, one which i hope to follow in my quest to become a director and a screen writer."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imauhcc,9,27 July 2020,"In addition to watching the film I also read his novel, what I find interesting in this story is how a twelve-year-old child survived the mob run, until he could become a businessman and a mob leader"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marianmihalciuc9,10,14 January 2015,"The Godfather is one of that movies that has something ""out of print"". It seduces you from the beginning 'till the end. It has very many pluses from the background atmosphere to the characters construction. Marlon Brando he is obviously one of the best actors of all time. He is the type of actor that was epic for his time and if he could somehow appear in our days he will definitely rule. With only $286 million at box office, the movie was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. Others with big contribution has Francis Ford Coppola(director), Mario Puzo(screenwriter), Al Pacino(actor) and Robert Duvall(actor)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),velvoofell,10,29 September 2009,"The core of 'The Godfather' may be pinpointed in one scene. The youngest son of the Corleone crime family, Michael, wrestles with the possible fate of his and his family's fortunes as he sits across a restaurant table from the gangster, Salazzo, hungry for the power of the Corleones and the police chief in his employ. He looks down, wide eyed in thought but also at the raging fires of the abyss as he contemplates whether to flee the scene and secure the downfall of his family or kill the two figures who most immediately threaten his family and interests. A train's wheels on the track become the wailing of the damned as Michael pulls himself out of these thoughts, pulls out a gun and kills them. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Judas-11,,7 October 1999,"I've read the book.....I've seen the movie, and, trust me, I've been more entertained by stories before and since.  What makes this movie the classic that it is is the ""life"" brought to the screen by this group of fine actors.  After seeing the film, I don't think that anyone could imagine Don Vito Corleone being played by anyone other than Marlon Brando, who is possibly the greatest actor in film history.  Same with Al Pacino in the role on Michael.  The cold hearted and hot headed bastard that is Michael could not have been portrayed better by any other actor.  James Caan as Sonny and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan....these men were born to play these parts.  Even Talia Shire, who I really don't care for much as an actress, delivers one hell of a stellar performance.  Diane Keaton, too.  It's performances like these that you only see once in a lifetime.  These actors and actresses create real lives for Mario Puzo's characters, each with such distinct personality that after watching the film, I refer to the characters by their first names, almost as if I know them.  The characters are portrayed so well that one could create a mock situation in ones head and accurately determine how a specific character would respond to it. Don't get me wrong, I love the story line here, but it's acting which makes this film a classic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),HuyValentin,7,30 November 2019,"If you like the genre, go watch it.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dre_m_zengarta,10,5 March 2015,"just outstanding the sense or morality even thought what they do is wrong, you get a sense of pride and respect. at the end you do start wanting to create the same level of respect and love with your own family as if it was the same. defiantly deserves the word legendary as it is a timeless classic and should be watched if you haven't already."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),minguspingus,9,24 July 2020,"A masterpiece of a movie with great cast, very good script, good acting and directing. It almost feels like you are in the movie the whole time and you stumble upon these emotions surrounding love, loyalty and systemic hierarchy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),coolfasho-1,10,25 May 2007,"The Godfather, as so many before me, and so many after me will stipulate and emphasize is more than a family's way of life through crime. It not only projects the ironies, debacles, rises, falls and basic aspects of corruption but reveals the true meaning of family. Yes, it might seem odd and disturbing to allude to a people of invidious and ulterior principles to 'family', but when we characterize the word as an interface of love, commitment and connections through blood, no other type of portrayal is more symbolic than the Godfather. I will not bore and weigh my comment down through superfluous lines of the general story of the Godfather as so many others have done (and in better terms than I could possibly ever write). Rather, I will address a controversy which has spread amongst all fans of this enduring classic around the globe. In what way is the Godfather a reflection of family? Well.. to begin with the Corleones are family through blood. On a less literal level how does the Godfather epitomize the moral ethics of 'family'? The main component of a strong and progressive family is commitment. People may generally say 'Everyone knows that the most important part of a family is commitment', but this is where they are wrong. Most relationships in America are based on love or in a more ephemeral sense, infatuation. Commitment seems to be the more onerous and tedious part of love, simply because it is harder to sustain. In order to sustain a commitment one must be accustomed to routine. In order to get accustomed to routine it is imperative to have and hold an interest. Interest is where most love relationships break down because it simply cannot last. Most people are far too capricious to maintain an interest in anything (even as important as keeping a commitment in order to raise a family) for too long. This is where the forbearance of the Corleone family is outstanding. Through profitable business exploitation and singularly successful organized crime the Corleone's omnipotent infiltration of businesses often invoked anger in affiliate mafia groups seeking status elevation which ultimately resulted in the assassinations of Don Vito and Santino Corleon. Even at the breach of these two losses Michael Corleone readily steps up to the plate as the new Patriarch with rigor to supplant his former indifference. In just bloated proportions to 'ordinary' families in which commitment sacrifices time and money, commitment for the Corleones demands a greater sacrifice which is never too great for them to give. This is a sacrifice of life and security. Where the normal American family finds a sanction away from crime, the geography of their bounds is dwelled on by Corleones"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scottybryant,10,9 April 2015,"What can i say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, this film is a masterpiece it is a cinematic landmark, it is in my opinion, better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is great but this is such a more dramatic film. I love the beginning of this film when the undertaker is asking Vito Corleone for justice, it was such a beautifully shot scene i loved how Marlon Brando portrayed Vito it is one of if not his best performance (Apocalypse Now is his second) of his career. Te Godfather is in my top 10 films of all time and it will always will be no other film can change that. The Godfather will always be remembered as the greatest film of all time and will never be forgotten, i just love this film so much it actually was one of the inspirations that made me want to become a film director and I'm only 14, it made me actually made me appreciate film and i am glad i watched this even its sequel was amazing and is in my top 20 favorite films of all time but 3 was terrible it should have never had ever been made and i will stick by that as long as i live but i love Francis Ford Coppolas direction of the film it will never be forgotten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chelo_piter,10,25 November 2014,Best movie ever you need time to watch it..
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grotoloross15,10,27 August 2015,"I was initially cynical before watching this movie; I thought it would be hard for it to justify such a high average rating. Having now watched all three, the first Godfather is by far the best, and deserves the title of one of the 3 or 4 greatest movies of all time. The acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is incredible, and this movie has immersed me in the world and created a level of suspense and anticipation that I have not felt before with any other piece of cinema. Without spoiling any of the plot, the twists and turns and overall composition of the movie is spectacular; although it is 3 hours long, you end up never wanting it to end. I think a lot of credit needs to go to Mario Puzo for his incredibly intelligent plot in the first instance, and overall this is a must watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),danhess-52933,10,13 April 2023,"Simply put The Godfather is the perfect movie. Coppola brings together a cast that delivers and a story thats timeless. I can watch this one over and over again it's something that hurt gets old and as an aspiring film maker one that makes me going. The film is a masterpiece of storytelling, with a gripping plot, memorable characters, and iconic scenes that have become part of cinema history. The themes of family, loyalty, and betrayal are expertly woven into the narrative, and the cinematography and score are both exceptional. In the end I can't wait to try to make a movie like this one in the future."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nathan-1,,16 April 2004,"Sorry, but after all the hype between LOTR_vs_Godfather debate, I decided to check this film out. Being a huge fan of LOTR for many years, I wanted to see it from THEIR perspective. But I was expecting SO much more - what did I get? An uninspiring 'epic'. Where was the storytelling? Where was the superb direction. And I know what i'm talking about when it comes to GOOD films (A Clockwork Orange, The Pianist, The Great Escape, The Elephant Man, The Evil Dead and any Ray Harryhausen masterpiece...) and this doesn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, I love gangstar films - but not this one. Sorry, this isn't the 'greatest' movie of all time. Go rent SPY KIDZ II or something... I can't understand how this compares and tops the movie list...everyone i've spoken too (apart from my mate Justin) hates this film. If it was THAT good, everyone would own it on DVD which they don't ... go figure..."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mamoru-sama,4,13 May 2022,This is honestly the most one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. No way in hell does it get so many good ratings based on anything more than sheer nostalgia.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmedwolf2011,10,17 January 2015,"the best American films ever made thank you This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Pierre_D,9,18 May 2012,"Once again delving into IMDb's Top 250, we come upon The Godfather. Long since clichéd in its use of ""Offer you can't refuse"", the horse incident and its view of the mafia, Godfather remains compelling 40 years after its release."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheBeedy,10,19 January 2002,"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino need I say more!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Surecure,10,24 May 2005,The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2 represent a defining moment in cinema. Few films can claim to be such an integral element of modern film-making as Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's masterpiece that explores the downfall of a man born into the world of the Italian mafia. To describe either film as being perfect is not an overstatement in any means.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),melkor-3,,26 November 2004,"Today, it is by far agreed that The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematography that presents us with a purely masculine, yet passionate reality of the world of gansters. Unfortunately in my case, this very masculine approach to the movie is what makes it a bit dry and well...unpolished...unpolished to the point that I would not call it a masterpiece and I would definitely not have it ranked as #1."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FounHUGO,7,7 December 2018,"Although rave reviews, but bluntly speaking, the traces of this film era are too obvious. It should be classified as an old-time movie before the watershed of a certain era.
The plot, setting, performance, rhythm... Basically all aspects have reached a very high standard with the standard evaluation at the time. But at the same time, it is also greatly limited to the framework of old-time movies.
If measured by modern life rhythms and aesthetic habits, the film's plot and rhythm are long and tedious, the performance is deliberate and formal, and the amount of information is not large... In short, it is not good-looking."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),godfather117,4,15 February 2007,"I am a 14 year old film buff and have just set up my account on IMDb if i had set this up earlier i would have commented on this film before now. I watched the Godfather when i got it as a Christmas present 3 years ago, when i watched it i immediately thought wow what a let down!! everyone who i spoke to had said it was one of the best films they had ever seen. But i disagree, there is no denying that the acting and direction in the Godfather is sublime but it is the fact that it is so monotonous, many people will say that it is because i am 14 but i have seen many films including other Coppela films such as The Conversation and Apocalypse Now, which is my favourite film so i definitely am not saying that Coppela cannot direct but what i am saying is that he could have done so much better with the script, the talent and the locations. So overall I am saying this: The Godfather is not a Bad film just very poor and it is definitely not all it is cracked up to be. Thankyou for reading my review."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fevzimfk,10,21 December 2004,This movie is unbelievable. Now we are almost in 2005 years.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ilie_9090,10,27 October 2014,"One of the best movies of all time has in it's cast some of the best actors of all time , some of them already had been nominated or won the academy award and the others won it after their performance in this masterpiece. Let's not forget Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzzo who had a big role in this movie's success beside the actors performance. The movie shows almost every aspect of life switching from emotion to tragedy in a unique way , as the same with the characters witch is Michaels case , changing from a loving young man and uninterested of power to a man that is unflinching in his belief. That in one word : Breathtaking"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheKingKong28,10,19 September 2013,"Well where to begin this film for me is the pinnacle of film. Its beautiful in every way. The music, acting, scenery, is virtually perfect. Marlon Brando for me gives the stand out performance in a fantastic cast. The film is captivating from start to finish. There really isn't enough praise I can give for this film, it really deserves its name in the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest. The film does a brilliant job at immersing you into the story of the Corleone family. You will struggle to find a film as engrossing and powerful as this one. I only wish films of today where made with such passion and brilliance. 10/10 a must watch for any film fan."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Shaolin0036,10,27 April 2002,"The Godfather was one of the first ""classic"" films I ever watched, and even after viewing other highly regarded films (On the Waterfront, Raging Bull, Citizen Kane, Gone With the Wind, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Third Man) it remains my favorite.  Although it may not be the greatest film of all time (that honor goes to Citizen Kane), there will always be a special place in my heart for The Godfather.  The seamlessness of the story and the richness of the distinct characters make it such an enjoyable film to watch that I am in awe every time I view it.  I have watched it in whole or in parts dozens of times, and it is simply one film that I will never tire of."

I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. Judging from this opening statement I know that these film lovers will aggressively spout out and say that I am 100 percent from about the Godfather...

I of course (like anyone with sense and taste or knowledge of film) was extolling the unlimited virtues and impact of the REAL best picture of all time, Citizen Kane. He meanwhile was arguing for the Godfather and I just figured it was his immaturity or possibly his ignorance and then when told me to go to imfd id10t or whatever this site is I was ASTONISHED to find that there were a quarter of million other people who agreed. Habadashery!!! There could not have even been a ""godfather"" without Citizen Kane, ALL of modern film owes a debt of gratitude to that film and anyone who knows anything about film making knows this.

I like Micheal corleaon charter and Vito corleaon voice very much. First two movies are awesome but the third one have some disadvantages that's why i didn't like that a lot but that one is good too. A very good family war between five families. Corleaon family manage everything between families. I play GodFather game also but after when i see this movie. Now i am playing it on Kabam.com. I only want to say that i like this movie a a lot that way i do a lot with this movie.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Arkaan,10,31 December 1999,"From the wedding scene, the ""I Believe in America"" speech, and the horses' head in the bed, there has not been a better film.  While you may think this designation is undeserved, you would be wrong.  Few movies have slipped into society like this one has. The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.  We get to know all the characters, from Don Vito Coreleone (Marlon Brando, in a masterful performance) to his sons, Michael (Al Pacion), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). "

This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan & Talia Shire."

And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Why this movie didn't win all Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lucianomarzo92,9,9 September 2009,"I just saw The Godfather a few days ago. It is a classic movie. Its one of the most well-made movies I've every seen. Its every bit as good as everyone says. I may not give it the title of ""The best movie ever"", but its just as good if not better than any other ""best movie ever"" candidate. Its very realistic. Throughout much of the movie you feel like you're with the characters. You feel like your in the same room with the Mafioso's. Marlon Brando was perfect as Don Vito Corleone. I don't really think his performance could have been any better. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was great, almost as good as Mr. Brando's (and that's saying something). "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kostasxrysogelos,10,9 September 2006,"The year is 1970. F.F. Coppola has just directed ""The Rain People"" (1969), a good, but not great, movie, starring R. Duval and James Caan. Coppola is then offered to direct the Mario Puzzo best-seller, ""The Godfather"". Coppola accepts, but has his own suggestions for the leading roles: Marlon Brando shall incarnate Vito Corleone -the ""godfather"", while an unknown actor, someone called Al Pacino, is suggested for the most important role in the film; he'll play Michael Corleone, the second son of Vito, the soon-to-be godfather. Paramount isn't very keen of either suggestions. They'd prefer George C. Scott for the leading part and Dustin Hoffmann or Jack Nicholson for the role of Michael. Pacino is discarded for the unforgivable crime of being ""a midget"". Brando, the unconventional ""bad boy"", is out of question. Coppola finally got his way. Thankfully."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),furetto1986,10,6 November 2005,"Since 1972 lots of words have been said. I think that there are just 2 options: -or you let me write nineteen full books about that, -or you better watch it, even if you think it is not your kind of film. Just watch it. It's really the top. Just a little of it i can say, just like a mirror. It is the top about Marlon Brando working. Even better than his acting in Apocalypse now or...anything else... You can understand it above all in the interview released in the post production period. Some of the particulars which made his character such complete, have been just an intuition of Marlon Brando or Francis Ford Coppola. This thing has been taken like an example for all the cast and... that's the result."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FilmActuary,10,5 October 1999,"This is hands down the greatest movie of all time. Great story. Great thematic elements. Great acting. Great cinematography and editing. Fabulous. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, Talia Shire...perhaps the greatest cast ever assembled."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ansango,8,24 October 2015,"The godfather is widely regarded as the greatest film ever made in the history of cinema.Widely considered a milestone,the movie inspired countless films. It might be a shame to admit but i hadn't seen this movie until 2015.After nearly 42 years of its release i finally got a chance to watch it.After watching the movie i found its story to familiar.It is because i have watched countless movies which are directly or indirectly inspired by this film and i must say that this movie was far better than those rip- offs. The movie has a great story.It shows the transition of a reluctant family-man to a crime family boss.The screenplay is absorbing.The cast is wonderful and everybody is peerless in their respective roles.In short this film is superb and wonderful.But i can't consider it as a great film.I don't know why it is called so?May be it had been a very original story during 70's but now it is not so.I am not a film scholar,neither i am a movie buff nor a cinema aficionado but i have seen many classics of World cinema and i found some movies which are far better than this one. I am not saying that this is not a great film.It is great,after all so many people like this and so many can't be wrong.This is a respectable movie after all this movie has influenced countless films.This movie might be great but not the greatest ever. This is an excellent example of mobster film.Positive points of this film are its evergreen story,its soulful musical score,its engaging screenplay,nice direction,great dialogs and amazing acting.The only negative point of the movie is its slow pace and overlong runtime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),epichiphop,7,4 March 2019,I didn't grow up then but in the modern era having now watched this film it's no 10. The acting is overdone and the multiple characters dropping like flies makes it hard to keep up.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),typingonwriters,1,24 November 2015,Terrible... Just terrible. Nauseatingly dull and exceedingly over-hyped. Honestly I could never even think to sit through any of Diane Keaton's acting in my life it is so horrid. Possibly the worst acting that I have ever even witnessed! (Let me tell you I mean that about every single person that is in this film).
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Chris J.,10,5 November 1998,"Marlon Brando's stunningly rich and complex portrait is just one of the many perfections this modern classic has to offer. But--Part 2 is bigger, better, richer, and better in every way. Not to diminish what a stunning achievement this film is.  One perfectly realized scene flows after another, building one on top of the other. A moment of family and togetherness here, a crescendo of violence there, betrayal, duty, honor.  It follows most of the rules established in early 30's gangster films like Scarface, Public Enemy and Little Caesar but is not limited in what it can show and attempts to tone down the melodramatics to a more realistically paced level.   Nearly flawless.  Some of the finest casting and ensemble acting you will ever see in a film by a brilliant director at the top of his craft.  It makes no apologies for forcing you to care deeply for characters who are violent, selfish, greedy criminals.  It makes us believe that at times there really is honor among thieves.  Somehow these people's class system seem fairly acceptable to us--though ultimately cruel, and doomed to end violently.  An essential film. On of the top 50 films of all time to be sure."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sergio91,10,4 July 2014,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in my opinion one of the best American film ever made and The greatest gangster film ever made. The Godfather is worldwide avowed as one of the greatest films in world cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nnennayvonne,10,5 September 2013,I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined. i love how the scenes are laid out. i love old movies and I love romance films mixed with thriller. So this is definitely one of my all time favorites. I would recommend it to anyone young and old. There are some intense scenes as well. I would love to one day be in a movie sort of like this. But it would add such a flavor that people wouldn't expect it. I also like the idea of a super natural being who has many sides that we haven;t fully figured out. I am a movie lover and this is by far one of my favorites. I think when creating my own trailer I want to take small hints of sadness and hope like this film and include it in mine
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),loganfoster,10,7 January 2019,This is a movie where everything seemed to come together. Great cast. Film score on point. The sets are very well done. The story is compelling. A truly iconic film!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AlbaEGarciaRivas,10,14 May 2014,"This is a classic film and the actors are truly amazing. An epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Thanks to RT and other reviewers."

The films is a stirring drama filled with poignant moments throughout."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ramydaniel,9,6 October 2015,"If you're a filmmaker this is a must watch film, break it down to its smallest detail. cinematography and lighting is one of the best i've seen in any film, very inspiring! I would watch it over and over and over. do not be afraid to underexpose. great directing character, everything about this film is grate. production design is on point and so does all the other elements of the craft. after watching this film from a director of photography point of view you develop more ideas and become very passionate about the way you handle your shadows, it's unbelievable how they achieved this kind of accuracy of exposure latitude with the tools they had back then back in the film era. Inspired and motivated to go experiment with lighting on my own of this practical style. masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jprater-2,9,25 August 2006,"I'm sure you may want to argue with me. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. This is a terrific movie on many levels. Pacing, Script, Lighting, Sets, Everything is top notch before you even get to the superb acting. This film demonstrates the ability to show violence in a shocking way and some people used it as a normal function of business. If you want to know what my #1 mob movie is...see Miller's Crossing. This is the best of the Godfather trilogy. Another bone you'll probably have to pick sometime. My favorite thing about the movie is probably the sets and locations. Choosing a favorite line is difficult. I appreciate the relative small use of profanity. ""He's been struck by the thunderbolt"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gerbinator2009,10,7 September 2008,"People lately have been having heated debates about TDK and the Godfather. Which is better? Everyone has their opinion, and I start my review with a Latin proverb: De Gustibus non Disputandum est. This means you can't argue with taste."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rmj012,10,24 September 2013,"""The Godfather"" is the perfect film. The 1970s was the greatest decade in the history of motion pictures for turning out masterpieces. Above all else, what captures the viewers in this movie--arguably the decade's premier masterpiece--is the stark dichotomy of family bonds versus terrible betrayal. ""The Godfather"" causes viewers to be enthralled by the harshest possible realization of moral relativism that could possibly be imagined. But admittedly, it is our connection to and fascination with the Corleone family--every bit as dysfunctional, violent, and disturbing as one would picture an organized crime family to be--that makes this film only more beloved and respected as the years pass on. For example, when fans of the film discuss what they love about the movie, the expected level of disturbing violence in it is rarely mentioned as being remarkable. What fans remember most is the great writing and the spectacular performances. Fans are thrilled to see a dark side of American life from a distance and that very few people ever see all while they root for their beloved Corleones. ""The Godfather"" has stood the test of time, and it always will."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cemturc,6,21 November 2021,"Same story could be filmed much shorter.. Unnrcessarly long. In 3 hours very few things happen actually. Despite very long duration, there are still many disconnections among timelines."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imdb-5032,3,18 December 2004,This is a movie for people who want to watch fat guys eat pasta.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PredragReviews,10,14 June 2016,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people (even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),caamarciniak,10,31 December 2014,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a ""family"" of New York who is happy because Connie (Talia Shire), his daughter, married Carlo (Gianni Russo). But during the party, Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto) is seen in the Don Corleone office asking for ""justice,"" revenge actually against gang members, who brutally beat his daughter because she had refused to have sex to preserve the honor. Vito discusses, but the arguments of the Bonasera sensitize and he promises that the men who abused Bonasera's daughter will not be killed because she was not, but will be severely punished. That's the best film of history, a lot of people don't lie. Vito but makes it clear that it can call Bonasera some day to return the ""favor"". Outside, in the middle of the party, is the third son of Vito, Michael (Al Pacino), a very decorated Navy captain who just returned from the 2nd World War. University educated, sensitive and perceptive, he is hardly noticed by most of those present, except for a college girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who has Italian descent but he loves. However there is someone who is well noted, Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), a singer of romantic ballads that causes screams of the young people who border on hysteria. Don Corleone already had helped him when Johnny was still in early career and was bound by a contract with the leader of a great band, but Johnny took off career and he wanted to do a solo career. To be his godfather Vito went to see the leader of the band and offered $ 10,000 to let Johnny go, but had refused the request. Just take the pieces of this master piece, like unforgivable actuation, bring proud to family and power. Still hope that one day came a film that compare with this. A realistic and chocking picture of as mafia do their job at 40's. A master piece of incalculable value. Marlon Brando has a perfect actuation, leaving a stone in the cinema as the most respectable and acclaimed character by the public and critics."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thediggens,10,30 May 2014,"The Godfather is rightly regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, and this review won't seek to be a mere repetition of its finest qualities. Technically, thematically and theatrically, the film is an undeniable masterpiece. It took what is an enjoyable, but pulpy, populist crime novel into a deft piece of art. One can only attempt to highlight some interesting observations here."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),IgnacioMelogno,10,17 October 2015,"The great cast and the spectacular acting made this movie one of the best in the history. It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. ""The Godfather"" is my favorite film of all time. It is absolutely legendary. This film, redefined the gangster genre. ""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece. Everything about this movie is perfect. The performances are absolutely pristine. Marlon Brando gives the best performance of all time, in my opinion, as Don Vito Corleone. I love to think that dramas start one way and finish another but this movie leaves you at the edge of you seat. Love the cast as well! I love the dramatic scenes hype the memorable scenes as well and the way people are able to convey their feelings without it being overbearing. the energy and magic is defined."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jimmy-14,10,20 January 2001,It is no wonder why The Godfather is consistently ranked #1 by registered members of the Internet Movie Database.  It is quite simply a great film in every respect.  I won't rehash all the points that affirm why this picture is an undisputed classic that will be as relevant 50 years from now as it was in 1972.  
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tastyhotdogs,9,24 June 2009,"Rewatched this for the first time in about 12 years. The last time I saw it I don't think I was ready to appreciate it's brilliance, as it was a tad slow for me back then. Glad I did."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),soroosh-haddadan,9,6 January 2019,"I have seen this movie over 20 times now and i can say for sure this picture should never be touched and is what they should teach in college and universities for Art major and any one should at least see it one time ,it teaches you life experiences from 40 years ago that still applies to modern lifestyles."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Petey-10,,7 July 2004,"This is a movie about New York mafia family, The Corleones.Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is a movie that every movie lover should see.It has some classic dialog and many legendary scenes.The characters are brilliant, kind of people you care about even though they're gangsters.And the actors, they're really unforgettable.There are Al Pacino, James Caan, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Abe Vigoda,the very young future Oscar winner Sofia Coppola and then of course Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone.Unfortunately we lost this incredible actor July 1st.That was last week.We sure will miss him.He was one of the greatest actors in the world."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bull-frog,6,18 January 2007,"Because of all the hype surrounding Godfather, I decided to take the plunge. I started out reading the book. I read the first 40 pages on a long flight. Not wanting to spend endless hours reading nearly 500 pages, I decided to watch the movie instead. I have to say I was disappointed. Godfather is basically a soap opera shortened to 3 hours."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dorktron,2,2 February 2000,"Simply put, this is a very poor movie.  The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time).  Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds.  The closest explanation I've gotten from anyone I've talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because ""it's the Godfather."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),talhaislam,10,20 October 2018,Watch this movie if you have eyes. Really good with acting and in depth meaning and good characters that you will love but will despise.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sherief_8060,10,2 January 2014,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fritz-17,10,26 September 1999,"Watch any other film and tell me it is better... The only legitimate argument is the sequel. The story,  the photography, the casting,  an artistic statement of the first degree."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Cutesy2,10,22 April 2014,"THE GODFATHER,"" which has been re-released on its 25th anniversary, is a jewel that still glows across time -- and in the dark. Gordon Willis's cinematography, considered revolutionary at the time, plunged its characters into pools of semi-darkness. Studio executives -- always the last ones to get it -- howled in the screening rooms. But in this saga of an Italian-American family's bid for power, we were watching the American Dream operating in the darkest shadows."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrmystery99,10,21 May 2018,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definite film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PRAKASH_VARMA_KAJULURI,10,31 August 2020,I have been watching movies since last 35 years but have never been drawn more to a movie that can influece you to make your own film. Thats what made me a film maker to be honest. Reading Mario Puzos Godfather and seeing how it translated onto the silver screen told me how the writer in me could become the person who can visualize.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vay-be,10,20 April 2007,"perfect, real perfect. when i watch this film, i fell it whole my body. and Al Pacino acts unimaginable. thank you Coppola. All the people that like watching movies all over the world, know THE GODFATHER. and nearly all of them say that it is the best film i have ever seen. Marlon Brando acts one of the best acts of movie history. for me Al Pacino acts the best of best all times. Mario Puzo wrote the best story and Francis Ford Coppola directed great. so it is the best really best. Everybody want to watch films near real life. The Godfather is real. you can feel it. i wish all the film like just The Godfather. Thanks all."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),miran_kor,9,20 September 2003,"I saw this film (at the theater) as a kid in the 70' upon its initial release. And, of course, was impressed.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Hassard1994,,14 June 2008,"I've been wanting to see this film for a while now, so i bought the new Godfather box set - The Coppola Restoration. I was worried that i wouldn't enjoy the film, because it is #1 here on IMDb and i had high expectations, i wasn't disappointed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yourbigpalal83,7,6 April 2006,"There is no doubt what so ever that the godfather is a classic film. Hell, some even say its the best film ever made. I on the other hand, think its a great film with some flaws."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Allrevvedup,2,26 September 2023,"I tried to watch this movie with an open mind,
despite being quite aware of the many high-praises that this film had garnered over the years. I paid very-close attention and I watched the whole movie very carefully."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fetuma76,10,4 August 2014,"The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kanan_dreamer1,10,30 August 2009,"This Movie is Awesome. Every character has done Justice. Story line is perfect. I have never seen any Movie better than this one. This is like a BluePrint for the Movies of this Genre. Francis Ford Coppola,Al Pacino,Marlon Brando all of them created History. It keeps viewers guessing what will happen next,every second of this 175 minutes movie has kept audience excited. This Movie has everything like family, loyalty, greed, relationships, Love,Betrayal,Gun Shot,Romance. The plot excellent for it to get ten out of ten, I give this movie ten out of ten, as I stated earlier it's far from predictable.It is a real piece of gold which will shine for the life time.A must watch movie for the movie lovers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JamShok,10,6 January 2007,"there are no words to express the way i feel about this movie. watching it was like looking into the eyes of God, and knowing that i was his most glorious creation. i give this film a ten because it is one of the most incredible movies ever made, and because it is nothing short of perfection. the acting is superb to say the least, the directing is legendary. the sets were monumental. this is a film that should be shown to newborns as they break from the crest of there mothers womb, it should be the first sight they see. i salute every member of the crew, from the star actor right down to the guy who swept the floors after the last day of shooting."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Malexolson,10,4 August 2006,"How can you doubt it? From the very moment the picture started, I had goosebumps. Marlon Brando gives an excellent Oscar winning performance, that I can't imagine anyone else playing Don Vito Corleone. Not to mention its Oscar nominated actors in supporting roles, Al Pacino, James Caan (who should have won), and Robert Duvall. The directing is absolutely spellbinding, the cinematography is terrific, costume design is great. To me, there is no better mob movie that explains the troubles of a Italian family in crime. I have many many favorite scenes, especially everyone else's favorite scene when John Marley finds his prized horse's head in his bed. There's that, and when Michael sends his guys to whack Moe Green and others during his baptism. The saddest scene in the film was when Sonny gets murdered, I know he was an ass-hole but he was cool too, it upset me so much I almost couldn't watch it anymore. I think the only scene that grabbed me was the very beginning of the film, when a man asks for ""justice"" over his daughter. I don't know why it always got my close attention, maybe it was because it was the very first scene in the movie, but ever since I was hooked on seeing that first scene whenever I would watch it. People often say that the best thing they get out of this film is Al Pacino as Michael, but I sort of disagree. Al Pacino launched his career in this movie, but the key element in this movie is Marlon Brando. This is the best and my favorite performance he has ever given in a movie, mainly because it was the first movie I have ever seen of him. I can honestly tell ya, that there is nothing like The Godfather. Ever! 11/10!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TommyKoponen,10,8 February 2014,"The Godfather is a not just a film but its a movement, it defines the past of the Italian American culture. A past that many American Italians are ashamed of but a past that I think the American people should know about. Any Italian could tell you that the principles of family that are portrayed in this film reflect the traditions of the old country. Family comes first before anything, this is a value that is passed down from generation to generation in the Italian culture, it was good to see that Coppola portrayed this in such a strong manner. It takes filming to a whole new level and changed the way we see films. Brando, Deniro and Pacino are genius! The acting compliments the impeccable work of Francis Ford Coppola. In my books this is a must see film, the book is not so bad either. The work of Coppola makes a long film seem like minutes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yokojan-mixtla,10,27 July 2020,"When I first saw this movie I was 15 years old and I liked it so much that since then I have watched it like 15 times.
the performances and soundtrack are very good.
the other two films in the trilogy are also good but don't beat the first.
if you like the genre of gangsters you have to see this classic"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheMan3051,10,7 July 2002,"What can you say about a movie that has so many great and popular dialogue? A film that has a famous character. A film that is so powerful, moving, brilliant, innovative, and stunning? "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joakim-vassvik,10,27 June 2013,"As much as I would like to do justice for this movie - there is little I can say that will help people understand the grandeur of this film. The Godfather sends you through a riveting journey into the life of one of the five great families. And with a cast as breathtakingly awe-inspiring as this, you are bound to be on the edge of your seat from the very first wedding scene."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),giulvezanti,,5 January 2015,Simply the best movie of all time.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eoinpgeary,6,6 December 2021,"Possibly one of the most overhyped movies I've ever watched, don't get me wrong that doesn't mean it's bad, I just think the reputation it holds is too big, I'm sure for when it came out it would be considered a masterpiece but now in 2021 I wouldn't say so"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidbretherick,2,6 December 2017,"The fact this movie is consistently called the best movie of all time absolutely baffles me. This isn't even remotely one of my favorite movies, in fact its one of the worst I've seen. Its 3 hours long, which is far too long, it's beyond boring and the story, or what little story there is makes no sense. I did not understand why anything happened throughout the whole movie, each death just happened for seemingly no reason out of the blue. Some of the actors mumble so much they are impossible to understand or speak in Italian without subtitles, which doesn't help in following along with what's happening. This movie does not deserve the extreme high praise it has received, not by a long shot. Its single redeeming factor to me is the excellent cinematography for its time, I'll give it that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bc1phantom,10,25 March 2004,"As well as previous works by Bergman, Wilder, Huston, Hitchcock, Speilberg, Lucas, Kubrick, Capra, Gibson and other greats that touch our souls as only a film of this nature could while sitting in a theatre.  If you don't keep this film in your heart and recognize it as the true mold for all others that took the same path, referencing it's style, you would be mistaken. It is on a different level, as the NBA's Michael Jordan is to most other players that came before him or have followed....Look up the word Classic in the dictionary and you should see a synopsis of this body of work along with Citizen Kane and others....Coppala, Pacino, Brando and Puzzo have created the starting point for others.... and their predecesors, can stand up and take notice and include them as one of the classics of all time......bc"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ren-vassilliou,10,1 August 2014,"What can I write about this movie that you don't already know,released in 72 and still to this day the greatest Mafia movie made, strong cast and strong Scripts and when you have that combination you have a hit on your hands that can never be bettered, at the end the quote of the movie,Connie to Michael""did you kill him ,"" did you kill him Michael? he shouts back "" never ask me about my business"" then the pause and then the Answer "" NO "" she walks out and the door slowly closes and the audience cannot wait for more until we got GodFather 2, THAT IS FOR ANOTHER DAY,Al Pacino comes into his own in this movie and as for Marlon Brando excellent performance,I only wished they kept him alive a little for GodFATHER 2,"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emfern13,10,22 October 2002,"This is by far the best Crime Drama ever made. It is much better than Goodfellas, which is good but it is a bit overrated. Marlon Brando is excellent in this movie. Although, sometimes I think of him as more of a supporting role than a leading role. He was still excellent. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all excellent in their supporting roles. I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joe_alonzo65,10,23 January 2007,"For some inexplicable reason, I've always put off seeing this movie. I remember trying to watch it a couple of times when I was in my early teens, but being unable to get into it. I'm 21 now and have finally gotten around to seeing this cinematic masterpiece, and it has now assumed the top spot in my personal list of favorite films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abed-nama-92,10,15 December 2014,"The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jksaikishan,10,28 May 2015,I really like this movie because i like the godfather name it makes me to watch this movie.The best movie i have ever seen I have seen only Godfather I but its amazing.The twist in the movie is the death of Godfather(father of Michel Corleone) while playing with his grandson Excellent Movie Gonna watch this movie again.... :)
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kyle-09486,9,30 September 2015,When I watched this movie back in elementary school much of it didn't make sense. The only parts I wanted to see where the violent ones and there are a fair amount. Then I tried to watch the entire trilogy in middle school and I made until the third movie and it was too boring so I didn't watch it all. Then again in high school I decided to watch the trilogy fully and I finally understood most of the story. Except for the third movie which people say is the worst. I still don't understand the third one. The story just confuses me so much to this day. Most will argue that the second movie was the best and I do agree with it. By now that I think of it all I remember is that that movie was mainly about don Corleones up-bringing and how he met some of the older members of the family like clemenza and tessio. All in all it was a pretty good movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),derrick-09925,10,4 March 2017,"The Vito had shown his outstanding leadership in the movie. Quite learn a lot from him!Especially the quotes came out from his mouth. The bad-temper Sonny, weak Fredo and calm Michael have shown us the characters of human being. The godfather is not a easy job. He is a leader and must always take care to each other. He need to be fair and discipline.The traitors must be executed even though you are the family members.Really hard to be a godfather. By the way, I vote this movie 10 for the Marlon Brando!Thanks."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Primtime,9,19 September 1998,"There is no doubt in my mind concerning the fact that The Godfather is the best movie of all time. From the flawless directing to the powerful acting, this movie is a must for every home video collection. Even today this movie still has the elements of surprise and shock which the majority of older movies no longer hold. Who could ever forget the memorable horse head scene. How the AFI ranked this movie number three still baffles me to this day. Coppola put his best forward and left all others behind."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sadeghi7,8,28 October 2016,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jimmy-128,10,12 November 1999,This is a film--it's too dignified to call it a movie--that shatters things we usually take for granted about the genre.  Movies are never as good as the books on which they're based--but this one is.  Films about Italians always wallow in stereotypes--but this one doesn't.  All-star epics always disappoint--but this one doesn't.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mentalcritic,,26 February 2001,"Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather was a sweeping tale spanning two generations with a tale that, as director Francis Ford Coppola states, is more the tale of a king with three sons than of a mob war. This view of the novel is surprisingly accurate, and the movie is helped along by it. Granted, the family at the centre of the story is in the business of crime, but the story is more about the family than the crimes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bellab1972,6,12 December 2022,I was actually married to someone in the same position when we went to see the Godfather and I'm afraid my review is marred by my experience. So much of the movie was ridiculous while some parts were accurate. I didn't enjoy watching this due to being involved in what was being glamorised on the big screen.. I found the mafia ISNT the highly regarded organisation it claims to be. I was told over and over they never hurt the innocent and there is a lot of honour in the mafia which I discovered is untrue. The backstabbing and lying even among family members is shocking and there is no honour.. absolutely none!

Greatest actors of all times played their parts Perfect! A movie means a lot of emotion. The perspective of life is very decisive in a 'Capo' life like Godfather's because danger strikes at every time when you aspect the most little of all. I'd love to see the movie over and over again, the originality hidden underneath it is barely visible. I hope that every person who wants a lesson for life could watch this masterpiece and see the hardest moments in life are made for toughness, to go in battle with life and win the battle, or at least try to . I wish i could've been in those years when the life was a lot more tougher than it is nowadays. Look at all the people that don't give respect but are pretending to have it but they do not do a thing for having it. Anyway, a masterpiece will heavily remain in our hearts among these special actors."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FatGlamBoy4815,10,7 August 2014,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm going to be one of those annoying people and say that the book is better than the movie, but the movie was still great. I've seen this movie multiple times and each time it gets better and better. I appreciate the fact that the movie stuck to the family business more than the book did, because that was one of the weak parts of the book when they talked about that one girls vagina for a couple chapters. Both the movie and the book were great though and I would recommend them to absolutely anybody who's looking for a good mafia movie that has an actual story and isn't just a bunch of random shooting."

He is very happy, when the life he is in hiding from reaches out to destroy his beloved. He sees that he can bring it to an end, and that he must do it. Even though he will have to assume a role immersed in this terrible world, and appear to do terrible things. He is a man who has seen his fate. In it's period context, this is an allegory of Europe realising that Fascism must be stopped."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),newkidontheblock,10,14 August 2004,"The Godfather is one of those movies that come around once ever so often that leave you in awe of it's greatness. Its a story of so many demintons, twists and turns and yet, it's not hard to follow. The Godfather is a film where it's hard to pick the bad guys from the good guys. It's a story of how even the most innocent of people can take part in the most despicable actions if the right pieces come to place. It's a story of family, love, hate, and murder. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a sure fire classic that wont disappoint. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zulmacias,10,22 November 2019,"The Godfather is as close to perfection as cinema will ever get in my opinion. I seriously doubt that I will ever watch a movie I love more than this one, Marlon Brando brings his quintessential performance as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino makes Micheals transformation from honorable war hero to ruthless mafia boss haunting and real. Every other actor is perfectly cast as well but those are just the standouts. The cinematography is simply stunning, inventive and revolutionized the way people shot movies. Every single moment in this movie is iconic and the dialouge is simply amazing, the climax is haunting as well. The Godfather is a timeless tradgey of corruption, I could write a novel on it but to put it into one sentence, the reason this movie is so great is because it does not fail in any aspect: the actors , cinematography, story, dialogue, characters, are all outstanding. The Godfather is a film that delivers in every department."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hegotgame_topgun1994,10,2 January 2006,"In Mario Puzo's the Godfather, the cast of Marlin Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Al Pachino, and Diane Keaton, is unique, and unbelievable. For the 10 rating, I am pretty much speechless. Never, have I ever seen a movie that was put together, in such a realistic, and perfectly graphical way as The Godfather. The way that the movie is outlined, is perfect as well as every other characteristic of the movie. Every actor was perfectly chosen, and uniformed to fit the outline of the movie, and the help the graphics and story-line of the movie become the best ever. Every actor in the movie not only had been chosen perfectly to play in The Godfather, but they were all chosen the perfect spot in the movie. My favorite part, is at the very end of the movie, when Marlin Brando, who was the current Godfather, died, leaving the job to Michael Corleone, his son. It was the perfect ending to lead into the 2nd Godfather, which was equally as good. I highly suggest, that you see them both. The 3rd one is terrible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nasarkkhattak,10,9 April 2014,"Mario Puzo creates a magnificent movie - a must watch, especially for the crime lovers. Though, not crime, but politics. In this movie, a complete world of the underworld is shown. Don Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone family, and almost the most powerful leader in the five families that make the main pentagon of the underworld. Vito Corleone has his two sons - Santino Corleone and Michael Corleone. His consigliere, Tom Hagens, who is also said as the brothers of Sunny and Michael after he was adopted."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Abdulxoxo,7,5 October 2020,"Already cited as one of the greatest of all time, but it's certainly not in my book. the movie is long. it features unnecessary scenes and the film would be as it is without them, esp the wedding scene at the beginning, it ran too long almost to the point of being annoying. the character of Micheal is pathetic, he left Kay, his lover and went into exile and then got married to some native girl and then she died, he then came home and asked Kay to marry without an remorse and in the most unconvincing way possible. he barely shows any emotion throughout the movie even the Godfather who has been in the business his whole life is not as stiff as he is."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shaolinstylin,5,6 July 2012,"It's considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic; it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff, it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes, and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion. You got tits and glamourized gangster machismo for the men, and scenic rural Italy for the women."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Michael_Pilkington,10,12 March 1999,"The acting and story telling is so powerful thanks to the teaming of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his novel).  Marlon Brando is the Oscar-winning titled patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, who struggles to keep his family together.  Oscar-nominated Al Pacino is the son Michael, who eventually takes his father's place.  Let's not forget the supporting performances of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire. This is a really perfect movie about the mafia that does everything in their power to stay on top.  Not to be missed, but if you can't say anything nice about ""The Godfather,"" then don't say anything at all.  My evaluation: **** out of ****."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),theshadow908,8,29 May 2006,"The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),juanpark,10,21 April 2015,"opularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yoyo_alexandru,10,3 December 2015,"Often advertised to me as the perfect movie, the best movie I'll ever see, and/or the be-all-end-all to movie-dom. It is a damn good movie. There's a reason Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan are household names. This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga. If it is too long (it is), a little slow in places (it is) and somewhat hard to follow in certain places (yep) we can forgive it, because they just don't make movies like this anymore. It isn't perfect, but it is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, and let yourself be carried along with the current of this slow-moving, but powerful, bit of culture."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),minneswanson,10,30 November 2011,"I recently watched the 1968 French film ""The Two of Us"" directed by Claude Berri, which tells of the development of a relationship between an anti-Semetic old man in the country who becomes the guardian of a young Jewish boy during World War II. (Actually, the title of the French movie translates better to ""The Old Man and the Boy"".) To me, it appears that the scenes in ""The Godfather"" where Vito is an old man in a garden playing with a young boy with a spray can were very much informed by this French film. The film would certainly have been available to Coppola and Brando during the filming of ""The Godfather"". Although it may be stretching things a bit, the actor who portrays the old man in the French film has a very distinct chin, and it may be that Brando came up with the idea of putting tissues in his jowls from observing that actor. I wonder if others have spotted these similarities."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),liam-norval,10,28 June 2014,"The Godfather is a great movie. From it's writing, directing and of course, the acting. The whole cast commits to their roles but the few that stands out are Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall. My favourite scene is where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) kills Virgil Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey at dinner. It's one of those rare feelings you have during a scene where you are cheering but feel guilty about it. What's incredible is that every scene is memorable in different ways. This is credit to the writers, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo and the director, again, Francis. The writing and directing is spot on, but I forgot another great artist, Gordon Willis, the cinema photographer. The film looks amazing, especially on the restoration and blu ray. This is one of the best movies ever made and every film lover should see it."

Now that I've seen the film twice in its entirity, I still am left to wondre just what the big deal is about this film.  Granted the performances and the casting was quite powerful for its day, but still as much as this film has held itself up over time, on my top one hundred list, this one goes somewhere in the low 70's."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jackzell94,7,9 March 2013,"The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and that's fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesn't give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you don't doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. It's such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),martymcfly95,10,6 January 2010,"The Godfather is a masterpiece in terms of cinematic achievements which boasts near flawless acting most notably from Brando at his scene stealing best. The film is brought to life with a strong script and a haunting score from Nino Rota. If you care for films, make sure you get out and see this. It is brutal without being unnecessarily graphic and moving without being unnecessarily sentimental. We build up a fantastic relationship with the characters and we care an awful lot when something important happens to them. It has been said that this film ""gets better as time goes on"" but I am not so sure of this as the general taste of the audience is not for this kind of film. It is a refreshing break from the mind-numbing trauma that is Transformers and other heartless Hollywood Blockbusters. One of the greatest films of the 70s? No. One of greatest films of all time!"

Mostly you'll hear a bunch of rambling about how everyone who likes this movie has really low IQ, as they struggle to put coherent sentences together. Irony at its finest ladies and gentlemen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stephen7272,8,20 April 2013,"If you lived in Sicily over the last 3,000 years you'd be pretty used to death and devastation by now. Sicily is bang smack in the middle of three prominent pre-Christian empires: the Greek post-Alexander Hellenistic empire, the Roman Empire and the Carthagian-Lavantine Empire. All three of them fought tooth and nail for 3 centuries to control Sicily. And I haven't mentioned yet the tyrants who used to rule Sicilian cities such as Syracuse, for whom the Greek engineer Archimedes worked. Then came the bully-boy, Normans, the Hapsburg Empire, Napoleon, Mussolini, the Nazis...oh where does it end?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Red_Identity,,12 February 2011,So I have finally seen one of the most iconic films of all time. How does it feel? Like I accomplished something. One has to be keen on not having huge expectations when one watches films of this grand respect and stature in history. How was it?
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thegamerproject,7,19 November 2019,Might just be me but it's overated. At the time i'm sure my grandad loved it but it just didn't do it for me. Go watch Goodfellas
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrbisco,1,23 January 2003,I really don't understand people sometimes.  Here we have the #1 rated movie on the list.  An extremely famous film.  A well made film in it's own right. But the story.  It's AWFUL.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Roger_Sterling,10,6 July 2006,"Is The Godfather the best movie ever? Does it deserve #1 on the top 250? That's up to you. I don't think it deserves it, but it DEFINITELY deserves a spot on the top 250. Only a fool couldn't see why Marlon Brando won the Oscar for best actor for his role as Don Vito Corleone, even though he turned it down. This probably won best picture easily, but I wouldn't know. To tell the truth, The Godfather should have won all 11 Oscars it was nominated for. Al Pacino and Robert Duvall were amazing in this movie. Some people call it the best of The Godfather series, and even though I haven't seen parts II and III, I don't doubt them."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tanelteder,9,3 January 2011,"The greatest film ever said by many. First film of the greatest trilogy ever said by many. I agree with second one, but not the first one. This is the greatest trilogy. And the first film is the pearl of that package. I drew my expectations extremely high before watching this classic. Unfortunately I had to fall. I didn't get the grain, that cutting-edge I was looking for. Fortunately the fall wasn't that high. I still liked the movie a lot. It was a great picture. A massive film in its genre. I like good mafia films. But I don't fancy them that much. But like I said, in its own genre this picture is a front runner."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jack-minaie,10,8 June 2014,From the first until the Last only the Best of All the Past
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jespersoegaardandersen,10,25 February 2017,"The worlds best movie. I simply love the story, the music, the acting, the casting, the filming, the dialog, the flow of the story line, the director, the editing. The audio commentary is also great fun. A 3 hour movie that feels much less. I have re-watched this movie 20 times and I'm far from done with it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moe-66681,10,15 June 2018,"It's not a movie, it's a living manual as a family man."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dorprv,10,23 March 2020,"If you wanna define this movie in a word, it would simply be 'Masterpiece', ridiculously flawless and extraordinary. The Godfather isn't a movie, but a piece of art, which make you feel the characters and their emotions, everytime they appear on screen.
The screenplay and direction, both are simply flawless, intriguing, charismatic and definitive. The characters are very well written and potrayed in the most delicate way.
The Original Score for the movie is gorgeous and bridges between characters and their emotions. It is simply the best score I have ever heard till date in a motion picture.
In a movie with deep characters along with a great story, the performances by actors are marvelous. Al Pacino, Brando everyone is awesome giving life to the story.
For a movie, about 3 hrs long, The Godfather provides edge of seat experience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brad_pitt,10,19 May 2001,"This film is basically the closest anyone is going to get to movie perfection. Coppola really hit the jackpot Puzo's novel and made the most out of it, I mean, many directors get their hands on some great stories and all they can do is mess the whole thing up. However, Coppola stayed true to the original novel, thanks in part to Puzo himself collaborating in the process of the screen writing, but also was able to give the movie his own feel, similar to what he did with Apocalypse Now. Also, visually, Coppola manages to show the 1940's mafia environment in the most stunning, and real, fashion."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rafraj,10,23 December 2013,"This is the most Original movies ever made! Nothing can beat it. Good actors. Good set up. Everything is GREAT! If you want to spend your time. Watch it! If you want to spend your money. buy it! You cant get better then this. All mafia movies don't get closer to this one. So don't think that other mafia movies are better. Al Pacino. he takes to whole movie over. It cant be better with him. This movie gets a lot of awards, and of it is old. For me it can have more awards then it already haves. This movie don't need any special effect. For its old fashion look it haves more character. Get it in the movie store fast if you can."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bharadwaj-muni,,12 October 2013,"Godfather, which is an adaption of a book by the same name, is one of the finest movies ever made. Both The Godfather and The Godfather Part II were selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and 1993, respectively. International critics routinely list these two among cinema's pinnacle achievements, sometimes considering them as one work. In the decennial 2002 Sight & Sound poll of film directors, the pair was ranked as the second best film of all time. Previous Mafia movies had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Zooha-47207,6,12 April 2024,"The Godfather, often hailed as one of the greatest films in cinema history, earns a 6/10 from me. While the movie is undoubtedly well-crafted and features stellar performances, its lengthy runtime diminishes its appeal somewhat, particularly for viewers who prefer a more concise narrative."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aedile,1,10 November 2002,"Title says it all.... This movie was long, and cut out the best parts of the book.  It had a good cast, but that can't make up for poor transition from the novel. Bottom line: read the book, it's better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),savannah-jackson,10,9 June 2009,the godfather is easily one of if not the best film in cinema history everyone gives great performances easily Marlon Brando and AL Pacino Frances ford Coppola directs the film well and everything is great the story is great and so is the film the story is convincing and many iconic performances and lines are featured James Caan and Robert Duvall give great performances the godfather truly deserves to be on the top of the greatest movie lists the plot interesting and manages to keep you watching throughout the film summary a stunning masterpiece that has changed movies forever and is easily going to be remembered forever the godfather is easily the best of the Trilodgy and was better than the best film of 1972 it could be the best film ever made the godfather is also good form watching before the godfather part 2
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bovanvojo,10,22 October 2014,This is the best movie i ever seen.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ajaysinghrockzz,10,22 December 2018,"I finally set out to take three hours to watch it this movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing The accents are amazing in this movie It is simply a great movie with great actors and great director I did get a little bored here and there it's too long But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),branko-draskic-801-39793,10,20 October 2013,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 41 years old and has aged well."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cool_and_unusual,10,25 August 2006,"I think the best attribute to this movie is the atmosphere it holds. A large amount of credit to that is due to the wonderful soundtrack. It's simple tunes represent the romantic, mysterious, dangerous life of the mafia. It adds effect at the right times to make the memorable scenes even more memorable. But the real reason I'm writing this isn't to rate the movie because I'm horrible at writing reviews. The purpose of this comment is for anyone who loved the movie that plays a musical instrument and is interested in learning a few ditties. It's not much but here are the notes to what I call The Godfather Theme."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yellowcab643,10,19 July 2013,I see that this show is #2 on the list of successful movies at IMDb so it would be impossible for me to more flatter it. I saw this movie when I was in Junior High School. My parents were all about Law School at the University and my feeling was this was a hero movie about an outlaw. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ivony,10,19 May 2003,"I cannot believe how long it took me to finally see this movie, especially since I love ""mobster"" movies.  But, no matter how many times they showed it on cable networks, I refused to watch it when it would be edited and cut to pieces.  Finally, I rented The Godfather and it was even better than all that I had heard from everyone.  "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pinky67,10,21 February 2000,"In my opinion ""The Godfather"" is the best movie ever made.  It is far and away the best conceptualized film from a novel that has been made, even when compared to ""Gone with the Wind""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rastreador,,20 August 2014,"Many words have been written about ""The Godfather"" since debut in 1972 and no doubt that all words are quite flattering, but always worth a few cents more about this great movie. The work, directed by then newcomer director Coppola, was awarded in the launch year and continued to receiving well-deserved awards, until soon became a landmark of international cinema . With substantial actors and flawless performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the story has traces of a true work of art. Its soundtrack also awarded, is absolutely amazing and remarkable. Who does not hear the chords of the soundtrack by Nino Rota and automatically remember the movie? Nobody or shame on you!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),satonub,6,15 February 2018,"Then you probably will love it :) I'm not a fan, not my type of movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Maul_40,1,18 January 2004,"I love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would, as ""normal"" people, never get the chance to know. It's a world full of traditions, family values, rich and explicit verbal and behavior language, but also a world of corruption, power, deceit and murder. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to create this Italian-American feeling throughout the whole movie, and it never feels superficial. It's a very good movie, but not extra-ordinary. I lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son Michael being dragged into the world of the mafia. It was a bit too easy. He gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop, and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody. I think I miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic. Anyway, trying to keep The Godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre. I think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position, so we can appreciate the film without all this hype. And we shouldn't be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fabrizio-sergi,9,17 September 2013,"Beautiful FIlm! The first time I saw him I was really surprised ... I think it is an absolute masterpiece of world cinema. I live among each other in one of the places where it was the scene of the encounter with Apollonia and subsequent marriage to Michael Corleone. It 'a film that appeals to all ages, however long, is full of twists and ideas more than interesting. My favorite character is Don Vito in which the wise direction of Francis Ford Coppola has allowed us to create a character that would become an icon of international cinema. I can not add anything to what has already been said to the Godfather ... I am sure that will continue to stay on top of forever, is a film that will never go out of fashion!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Lolanut,10,23 October 1999,"The film begins slowly and dramatically as a man begs the Godfather to pay ""justice"" to the men who have beaten his daughter.  A Godfather cannot refuse a request on the day of his daghter's wedding."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iambigeddie,9,25 July 2020,Beautiful movie by all standards. Old but great and all need to watch.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GoWizards1,8,8 August 2010,"I think The Godfather is very well-made and a good film on the whole; very well-acted, well-scored, and had effective dialogue, but I think it's somewhat overrated."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ruxandrasilvia,,10 May 2012,"The first question that came to mind when the ""legendary"" movie finally ended, was this: ""Has everybody gone mad?"". ""The Godfather"" is amazingly bad, start to finish. Al Pacino's talent is wasted in this sorry excuse for a film. No character development, no real plot, no redeeming value whatsoever! Just a bunch of low-life criminals and their self- importance. Fascinating, indeed! "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),HotToastyRag,3,31 January 2019,"I'm not really the target audience for The Godfather franchise, but I did go into the movies with an open mind. After all, I love heavily dramatic, soapy stories, I recognize the quality of the cast, and my mother's side of the family comes from Sicily. With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rcolgan,10,4 July 2014,"The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),m-rimmell,10,10 May 2016,"In 1968 I met the great man Marlon Brando with Charles Chaplin after the completion of 'A Countess from Hong Kong'.We all had lunch together. During our meeting I gave him a piece of amber on a leather string which I was wearing and he had admired and commented 'You are wearing the mystical stone ,20 million years in the creation'. He tucked it into his shirt. I have always wondered particularly as I watched Marlon in 'The Godfather' if he kept his promise always to wear it. I was told years later that he did ..but I have no way of knowing. Maybe someone out there knows.I was meeting the two great men in my capacity as an art dealer and they commissioned from one of my artists a portrait of Sophia Lauren in bronze..At 83 I am writing my memoirs to be titled 'SENTENCED TO LIFE'.Sir Charles and I spoke of the similarities of our beginnings..He in a Home for Waifs and Strays ...Me too...His mother confined in a lunatic asylum ..My mother too.'The Colney Hatch Insane Asylum ' in North London ..He then stated 'Remember ! From the moment we are born. We are sentenced to life'.As I wrote my memoirs 50 years later it seemed to be a perfect title .."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),obradsvv,10,5 April 2015,"Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself with The Godfather, probably the greatest movie in cinema history. Marlon Brando shows us his magnificent skills and his way of dominating the scene. The Don's relationship with his family is unique and incredibly well depicted. Looking at Brando's career, which is frighteningly impressive, to say the least, the role of Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt his best one. To say that Al Pacino was incredible in this movie and the rest of the trilogy would be an understatement. James Caan, in the role of Sonny, comes right after Brando and Pacino's stunning performances. Truly a masterpiece, The first part of this epic trilogy will forever be at the very top of my list."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kevin142,9,27 June 2005,"It is quite different from ordinary mafia movie. Of cause there are a few bloody scenes in the movie. But that is not the main point. The all time classic aimed at family life. That makes the mafia movie full of humanity. Although they are mafia, they are still human beings. They also cherish family though the way for protecting family is violent. That is the most attractive place for the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),basiventral,10,6 November 2018,"I am a chinese man and find that america has a beautiful culture, and this movie show the struggle of being an immigrant and having to struggle to live the american dream which is not easy. You can thrive in this land or die trying. Must watch!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),leomirelesortiz,10,31 December 2013,"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life, it is simply perfect in pretty much every aspect of it, from it's acting, to it's writing, this movie has it all. It stars Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in his greatest performance. Michael at first tries to stay away from the family business, but after his father is almost assassinated by rivals, he volunteers to murder the responsible, and after his father dies he takes the family business leading to the second installment in the Godfather trilogy. My favorite part of the movie is the baptism scene, which showcases both Michael's descent into darkness, and Francis Ford Coppola's great talent in directing. So in summary this is simply the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anthonyfewsterk,10,21 December 2019,"This breathtaking masterpiece tells the story of a crime family through it's rich script and dilemmas. The film has you the minute it starts with the profoundly sympathetic character at the start with his monologue about his daughters circumstances. From start to finish it blurs the lines between good and bad, black and white and begs the question of loyalty, family and power. The crime family with so much power and control cannot control their own family and it's affairs, ironic isn't it? Marlon Brando's performance is the epitome of flawless acting and Al Pacino's acting is seamless and sharp. The film does drag in some parts in my opinion but every film has its flaws and cannot be perfect because perfection is subjective. This film took the books version and perfectly puts it onto film, some say and even in my opinion is better than the book itself."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),philosovelociraptor,6,13 May 2016,"Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lacel-dacosta1,10,28 February 2015,"The Godfather is in my opinion the second greatest movie of all time. The pacing is flawless, the acting is absolutely mesmerising and the story is the most ""simply complicated"" one ever. Brando and Pacino were a match made in heaven for their characters and no movie will ever reach the pinnacle like The Godfather did. Stunning brilliant."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cryryux,10,4 October 2015,"Although when it comes to movies Goodfellas prefer mafia, Godfather can not deny that's the best movie about the mafia, maybe the best movie ever made .An impeccable direction of Francis Ford Coppola's part and a great script based on the book Mario Puzo's (who is also co-author of the screenplay) make an excellent movie .Jocul nose is high-class actors, Marlon Brando makes perhaps the best role of his career, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall are excellent and roles but it is curious that none of them earned Oscar statuette going to Joel Grey in Cabaret role, but whatever, it is so decided Academy members, who we eventually his Godfather is a conclusion contestam.In excellent movie that I recommend to all, although I do not think there's anyone who has not seen .not 10 course."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kvkienlin,10,6 May 2002,"Not often you will be able to find a film that is as good as the novel it's based upon. For sure the reason in this case is that Mario Puzo also wrote the screenplay. Fully recommended to read the book and to watch the film, in either order. Any more comment needless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zommoland,10,28 February 2017,First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely . 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Phrenzy,8,10 January 2000,"Well... believe it or not, this weekend was the first time I actually sat down and watched the Godfather all the way through.  Sure, it's great, but I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites of all time.  It does have a timeless quality, however, and brilliant nuances, even in the most in-your-face scenes.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, though I was probably the last one who hadn't seen it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ramydobia,10,30 July 2014,"Few movies that get my attention and makes me day dream about, and Godfather i,ii, and iii sure does that to me. I would lay in bed, office, or school and think about some memory moments during the movie, i.e., ""oof maroon only if I can have the bag of money"" as it is truly one of the many best moments in Godfather during the wedding, the driver for the Godfather wished he can rob the bag of money gifts which had all cash in it.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),symonm,,16 November 2011,"Often cited as the greatest film ever made, I can't 100% agree with that but along with it's immense sequel, it is certainly ""one"" of the greatest ever made. Like all celluloid masterpieces, it doesn't date. Sure some cinematic techniques alter, sound, lighting, colour and camera-work vary over the years, perhaps they're improved in general but these are transitional and often just fashionable points, not a reflection on the quality of a film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dpenzel,7,17 May 2005,"""The Godfather"" is a good movie that should have been a much better one. It has almost everything it needs: a stellar cast, a story based on a bestseller, great music, lush cinematography, etc. It makes a kind of visual poetry out of many of its scenes. But in the end it lacks a soul. As a movie about the Mafia, it made its characters too lovable, whitewashing the brutality, hypocrisy, stupidity and sleaze of real gangsters. We like the characters too much; we want to be like them, deliver their lines. It leaves out even the few ideas that the book had. In the end it is a story well told, but eventually, a story about nothing (not in the Seinfeld sense, either.)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),clarkma-08880,1,19 February 2022,"Technically there's a lot in this movie that looks appealing, it's competently produced in many, many ways. But I hate every character in it with a burning passion and just want every single one arrested and sentenced to hard labor post-haste; their concerns in the movie are of absolutely zero concern to me as a viewer and every moment spent on their stories feels like a waste of my time. It doesn't help it's hard to hear a lot of the dialogue and it just rambles on and on and on and I literally CANNOT keep my brain tuned into what they say in this film. I have never finished this film because it is impossible for me to stay tuned into it and/or stay awake, and I love lots of long, slow films! It's also not like I'm opposed to gangster films; Casino, Miller's Crossing, and Road To Perdition are ranked very, very, very high in my list of all-time favorite movies. The fact that this remains at or near the top of the IMDb ranking is proof positive that groupthink is alive and well amongst the movie reviewers. I would literally rank 1000 other movies I've seen above this, including many so-called ""bad"" movies because they're genuinely entertaining and The Godfather is pointless time-wasting misery."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sandnair87,9,31 March 2015,"The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mytuanghel-903-102638,10,28 May 2015,"One of the best movie ever made. It will put you in the set and be a part of the Corleone's family. Live inside the movie with the cast and share their memories and their feelings of love, hate and revenge. The acting of Don Corleone and his magnificent voice while stroking a cat at the beginning its a mental picture that will reappear in your head every time someone mentioned the name - Corleone. Inspired from actual events that happened from the 20s all the way to the 60s wrapped around in 3 lengthy but brilliant movies. The movie starts with an introduction to the family which portraits Corleone's family as a very close, respected family that want to try and stay away from trouble."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maiden-yokohama,8,4 July 2016,"First of all, it's been a while since I decided to watch The Godfather, but somehow I've never had enough will power to do so. I heard people saying it's the greatest movie of all time, but I was still being skeptical about this statement, as I couldn't imagine a movie with such long play time grabbing your attention all over it. When it started playing I could sense the outstanding feeling of the early 50's USA. It just felt natural to be part of this world, as we were born to it. The plot is not to be detailed, as it's one of the most famous movies, but I can assure everyone, this is the strongest part of the film. Of course there are some action scenes where bad people shoot with guns, there are some romantic scenes where beautiful woman make love with handsome man, but all of these give the essential of the Godfather. We learn the rules of this world, without directly being taught each of them. We become the part of the family, and we suffer or win, as the Corleones do. We start to worry about the characters, that feel alive and feel realistic. Our first, probably negative impression are getting overwrite by the deeper, and more considered emotions, which are more likely to be positive. We understand that some things have to be done, no matter what the morals say. Yes, we can live the life of the Corleones, and that's a thing not every movie can provide. The Godfather is not the best movie of all time, not for me at least. But it surely worth watching, not just because it's a legend, but for why it has become a legend."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sethmlanders,8,24 March 2015,"I wasn't too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sjwhite90,10,1 March 2015,"..Barzini's a pimp. That is my favorite line in this movie...There are many more lines. Lines that everyone should watch. Because this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best mob/crime movies. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, or anything else with Joe Pesci. You will like this movie just as much. The cinematic quality is fantastic. The dialogue and acting are very convincing and makes it feel like you are watching history, not just a movie. And speaking of history, talk about Marlon Brando. Good lord. The guy puts his existence on pause to breathe life into Don Vito Corleone as the Godfather. His roll is phenomenal. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bryantapiacastro,10,19 October 2018,"The best movie ever, the story goes in an elegant way, it doesn't bore you. Also, with the best performances in the history of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),leakretschmar,7,6 February 2005,"If you like mob movies, I guess this movie is for you but if you not be cautious. It is bloody and sad. It has a lot of themes and colors to describe the story, which is very interesting. If you really like this movie, I would recommend The Road to Pedition with Tom Hanks. It is not as bloody as this movie but it has a good plot. Godfather has a good plot but for me, it is just too much to handle. The movie would probably get away without so much blood but I guess you have to be realistic. I probably wouldn't watch this movie if I didn't take humanities, which is one of the requirements for my associates degree. Although my brother would eventually make me watch since he is a big mob fan."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RikkuXOXO,1,6 February 2022,I can't understand how people can enjoy this movie when it's so slow and still. I couldn't even stand the first 20 minutes. The atmosphere is all too quiet and it's all just people talking. A lot of people would rate this movie 10/10 and think they're intelligent or something.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SKG-2,10,4 March 1999,"I first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college, during a summer school class I was taking called ""Literature and Film.""  This was the second film they showed, I think, and from the moment the character of Bonasera comes on and says, ""I believe in America,"" this had me hooked. This is like the perfect meal, where all the ingredients come together - theme (gangsters as a metaphor for society, family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics), story, acting (Brando seemed a little overrated when I first saw it, but that's because he's not on-screen a whole lot; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"" ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli"") - and leave you completely satisfied.  And the scene I remember is not the horse's head, or the scene where Michael says he will kill Sollozzo and McClusky, but rather the baptism scene, which haunted me for days.  Incredible as it may seem, Part II is even better.  But I'll say more about that in those comments."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rejoefrankel,10,16 February 2000,"Much of my male wisdom and philosophy on life is derived from THE GODFATHER. It is one of the most powerful, poetic, dramatic, stories in history, elevated from pulp to high art by a brilliant ensemble cast, mythical direction and a riveting script.  Brando is forever enshrined by his performance as Don Vito head of the powerful Corleone crime family.  Al Pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the Don's son Michael, who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene.  It is a comment on the fallibility of the American dream.  How every good boy has the capacity for bad.  Every character resonates with authenticity.   Every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family.  THE GODFATHER above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family.  It is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll.  When loyalty was ensured through family connections, and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government.  A film that is truly epic in scope, and all encompassing in wisdom.  A masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),awesomesteinberg,10,24 April 2014,"When I first went into this movie, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Sure, it often was on the top of lists of the Greatest Films Ever Made, but that was likely to create nearly-impossible hype. (Which had previously caused disappointment upon my first viewing of ""Citizen Kane"") I had previously found the movie in an article called ""Movies You Hate the First Time but Love the Second."" And it was also three hours long, so it would definitely have its slow scenes. (I was only able to make through the first 90 minutes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"") Cautiously, I turned the movie on. And within minutes, all my doubts disappeared."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ledzep29,10,19 August 2006,"The Godfather had many in awe during its prime, and it still does today. One of the greatest organized crime films ever created, let alone one of the greatest movies ever created, it shows that anything goes as a mobster in the Itlian mafia. Al Pacino became world famous for his role as Micheal Corleon, son of Don Vito Corleon (Marlon Brando), as he prepares to take the family business from his father. As an Italian myself, I can greatly appreciate what this film is trying to do... show what life is really like as a mobster, and what they practically do. Forget the mobster movie flops, or the Sopranos, this movie shows it all. And to follow it up with an even greater sequel is incredible. It's a masterpiece, a must-see by far."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Masterkhan06,10,10 June 2015,"It's a thick character-based plot line. Just because there's not an explosion every 3 minutes doesn't make a movie boring. It makes it a drama. It's a genre that doesn't generally feature giant explosions and shoot-outs, because the conversations are where the real action is happening. If you don't like that kind of movie, you're not going to like The Godfather. I seen this movie before but I use to think its was boring but now I become a little mature and give a chance again and now I know that I was wrong about this but I just sit and watch the whole movie and it was great. I even watched part 2 and part 3. The Story is great and Acting is great too. You need to sit down and watch this movie carefully but its not for everyone. So Far its one of the best movies I seen. Plus it got great actors like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall etc."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Elizabeth-328,8,28 February 2000,"""The Godfather"" has become a classic in the 28 years since its release. It's definitely a great movie, that hasn't lost any of it's brilliance.  The problems of Don Vito's life are still strong today, especially the issue of drugs.  "

The Godfather is the best Mafia film ever made and also the best film ever made period. The acting is fantastic. Marlon Brando is brillianty as Vito Corleone aka The Godfather. Al Pacino is great as Michael but why is he a Supporting Role? James Caan is excellent, a standout performance as the hot tempered Santino."

This film has been made with exceptional eye for detail and great artistic performances. You have to listen very well and keep concentrated every second of this film, because everything seen and heard appears to be a vital bit of information. It is the best movie ever made, with some of the best actors to have ever lived. Marlon Brando is a triple-A class actor and he shows it in this masterpiece. This is one of Al Pacino's first movies and he definitely left his mark, his performance has opened many doors for him, but most of all, it made the best movie ever!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jackstunt99,10,8 August 2014,"The BEST Mob movie of all time. With all the Drama Character changes from beginningto end and the performances done by the cast makes the movies just Breathtaking. This movie was released on March 24th 1972. Even that early in the year you knew that is was going to be the best movie of the year and that Marlon Brando had the best performance all year. It was such a good movie that before they finished filming they planned The Godfather Part II. Another good thing about this movie is that even though there is countless mistakes it is still number 3 on America's Film Instunte's Top 100 movies of all time. Fred Roos,Andrea Eastman, and Louis DiGiaimo did a fantastic job on casting Marlon Brando,Morgana King,James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Al Pachino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and as well as countless others in casting for this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nicatumusoy,10,25 February 2015,"I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfather's essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Brano's Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legend's greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),IamMattsCompleteLackOfSuprise,1,16 September 2003,"The godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much. The roles of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated.  The direction is good not excellent,  the script is by no means ground breaking.  But many people still refer to it as the best film ever made.  Next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and wit(eg fight club) and more lavish directing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shoppingqueenz,10,19 June 2005,"the godfather is the greatest movie of all times. it is filled with drama, intensity, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. if your not in to the mafia and 40's gangsters then you really wouldn't like it,but if you are into it you will appreciate this movie. even though the movie has some faults, you really don't notice them with all the drama going on. i really wouldn't recommend it to people that faint at the sight of blood because this movie is nothing but blood. the only thing bad is i had to watch it two times because it was really hard to follow. it is so much easier to watch it by myself. if you miss one little thing you basically miss the whole movie. but i think that this is one of Hollywood's best movies!"

It is definately well crafted and the acting is superb. However the pacing is dreadfully slow at times and while I think overall the acting is strong it does get a little overblown at times.  Definately one of the best movies in its genre, unfortunately imho its not a genre with many good films."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hemansparks,9,30 September 2006,"Basically I thought that this movie was a piece of crap. In no way does Marlon Brando portray a decent mafioso. I'd rather watch Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. Speaking of how horrible this movie was, Al Pacino is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. Everyone talks about how great he was in Scarface. I mean I have to give him credit, he did go on to become a superstar with great films such as: Any Given Sunday, The Merchant of Venice, (and let's not forget) The Recruit. Talk about an amazing movie, add Colin Farrell and Al Pacino together and you'll get something Jesus couldn't even come up with. I mean seriously, how many times did they shoot Don Corleone and he was still alive? I just don't buy that. As an aspiring actor, If I would have read the script for The Godfather (part one, two, or three) I would have laughed and wiped my browneye with it. Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola for making a horrible movie. I recommend this movie to no one. If you are one of the millions who support this movie, I hope you burn for eternity. Check out Public Enemies if you want to see what a real Gangster movie is like."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),madgelhisayo,6,18 July 2022,"I really don't understand, and don't want to understand, why people are obsessed with this type of movie. Every violent scene makes me sick, and I don't want to go back to any of them. I even think that to treat such a film as a classic, even if it is highly skilled, isn't it secretly instigating more people to worship violence? Damn manly. It amounts to violence in some ways."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),youdontknowwhoiambutiamw,1,25 January 2006,"I could not maintain concentration throughout that film. When I heard it was on, I had high expectations. But I was throughly disappointed with how boring it was. I can't see how it was so good, it's just a load of Italians in America killing others. So boring I decided not to watch the last hour."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mysteryvoiceman,10,6 December 2019,Simply amazing. This is probably the only 3 hour movie I would ever watch
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Angeneer,10,31 October 2000,"Yes, it is perfect. Every praise you hear about it is true. When every aspect of making a film is top-notch, you get the absolute movie. I would like to note though, Godfather is NOT a movie to watch while eating your pizza. It needs you to be completely devoted to it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johno-21,10,23 March 2006,"I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and went back again and have seen it numerous times on television since. Francis Ford Coppopla has been fortunate to have not had just a single career defining masterpiece but several and this is one of them. He'll likely have one or two more masterpieces to add to his arsenal of enduring works before he is done. This ensemble cast is wonderful with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Al Martino and on an on. Nonimated for 10 Academy Awards it won surprisingly only three in Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Best Screenplay for Mario Puzo adapted from his novel with Francis Ford Coppola, and the big prize Best Picture. James Caan, AL Pacino and Robert Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, the most ever from a single film in an acting category but so many from the same film caused a split in the vote and Joel Grey from Caberet ended up with the Oscar. Godfather went head to head against Caberet for the 1972 Academy Awards with Caberet wining six to Godfather's three. The Godfather was also nominated for costume design, film editing, sound and music score. Omitted was Gordon Willis with his brilliant cinematography. Willis would go on to be a favorite of Woody Allen in photographing Annie Hall and seven other Allen films. Willis, like many involved in the Godfather would also do Godfather II and III. Production Designer Dean Tavoularis team of Set Decorator Phillip smith and Art Director Warren Clymer give this film a rich look and an excellent period piece atmosphere along with Costume Designer Anna Hill Johnstone. Nino Rota's music score gives the film the flavor of a fine Italian wine. He scored all of Federico Fellini's films in Italy including La Vita Dolce and 8½ as well as scoring such films as La Strada, Obsession, War and Peace and Romeo and Juliet in his long career. This film also features great non-original music from Berlin to Bach and Mozart. Editor William Reynolds would have had quite an ambitious editing project with this three hour film and his skill paid off. The sequel Godfather II was a great film and one of the greatest and most recognized sequels in film history but I would have left it there and not made it a trilogy with Godfather III. I don't know how long this film has been #1 on the IMDb top 250 but it will likely be there in that spot for some time and it will take a film made after it to knock it out of the top spot. Maybe a film not yet made. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sand_man002,10,14 October 2008,"The Godfather is indeed a great start for the trilogy and a great movie alone. The thing that I admired most about this film is the extensive quality of story, you always know whats going on if you listen carefully. It's really dramatic without getting too dramatic which is the fine line between effective and ridiculous, and The Godfather balances on that line perfectly. Cinematography is a part of what gives this movie classic status, the camera work gives the Godfather a slightly sinister effect with the shadows which is more apparent in some scenes set at night."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bongkong1,10,3 May 2009,"This has got to be the single greatest film ever made, the attention given to detail, to acting, to the cinematography, to the overall setting in such a short time was amazing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lesleyharris30,9,29 March 2013,"The Godfather is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. There is no questioning the sheer brilliance of this film, it is a perfect example of how movies are very much an art form, the beautiful set pieces and skillfully written dialogue are just two examples of that. The story grabs you immediately, despite the lengthy three hours, it flies by as we are engrossed in to these characters and their struggles, as Roger Ebert once said, a bad movie can never be too short, and a good movie can never be too long. The cast deliver some of the best performances ever witnessed, from the masterful acting of Robert Duvall, the engaging James Caan and the raw emotion of Al Pacino, they all showcase career highlights. The star of the show is, without a doubt, Marlon Brando, an actor with so much range and versatility, he is spellbinding as the Don, every word, every movement, has meaning, a well deserved Oscar win. An engaging story, pitch perfect performances and gorgeous direction, The Godfather is a must see for all moviegoers. "

Marlon Brando, to my eyes delivered the best character in a movie ever. Wow, such a great film. I started growing into Mafia movies more and now I'm obsessed with it. This is my 5th favorite movie of all time. The screenplay, acting, cinematography, dialouge, and directing were superb!! You have to see this amazing film!! Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and everyone else did marvelous. Thank god they made this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Muia17-1,10,29 July 2008,"The Godfather, there is so much to say about this movie, I mean it is incredible from beginning to end, taking you along as the main character, makes a change from a passive man to someone who has to step up and choose to do things against his nature for the good of his family. Marlon Brando is amazing in this movie as the Don, the head of the family, AL Pacino who takes over the movie deserved and Oscar for this movie not just a nomination, with a supporting cast that is phenomenal, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall etc.. The amazing part of this movie is after Marlon Brando's is almost killed and Michael makes the decision to take out Sollozo and and the captain for what tried to do to his father, after that scene Michael is never the same he realizes what he has to become and has to do to take care of his family. This movie deserves to be #1 on this site and everywhere, this is just my opinion."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Brian-272,10,5 June 2001,"Long before serial killers, heroes, comedies, and dramas you had this masterpiece The, Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola knew just how to organize this so well by showing how a family made a living and going to elite power in the process. Marlon Brando is the greatest as Don Vito head of the family, then open the door for son Michael Corleone played perfect by Al Pacino. The, Godfather helped make Pacino a household name. The, Godfather also uses one of the best film editing techniques possible the work of Russian film editor Pudovkin as his editing technique of linkage of shots adds to the drama of The, Godfather. The scene of the baptism is linked just at the very same moment with the murder scene of enemies sure it is not the best pace but the scene is just perfect, and the drama of the events is increased through editing by linkage of shots by comparing death to a baptism both highly valued rituals in the mob. The, Godfather is the best from everything with the filming, acting, and the story. As you know The, Godfather will be the greatest classic forever."

He moves his hand very quickly when being taken into the new hospital room even though he isn't supposed to be awake. - There are also some time/space inconsistencies in the scene where Michael shoots the police captain, but I've heard they removed in mistake in later versions of the film. Also, some of the lines at the end of the movie with Don and Michael talking in the olive garden seem to be out of order or ad libbed. -- I've heard that there are others.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adamjohns-42575,6,28 February 2021,"I went into this film with a chip on my shoulder that was determined not to like it and I was only watching it in order to scratch it off of my film poster. I don't like gangster films really, glorifying violence and illegal activities has never been in my wheelhouse, but I have to say that this one was so well made, so well acted and such a good story that I couldn't help but enjoy it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DiscoCide,3,28 April 2004,"If you want to see the quintessential american crime film?  Goodfellas. The Godfather is romanticized garbage in comparison.  Take a look at Coppolas' interviews about the godfather.  It is not a film he was passionate about doing, nor is he proud of the mafia legacy and he was a little bit insulted the studio thought he would do a good job just because he was Italian. Coppola purposely turned the story into a universal tale of a king and his family to avoid the broken, bloody and undressed view of the ""earners"" on the street.  He didnt want to focus on this, because of his aforementioned lack of pride.  He turned the mafia into a fairy-tale."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),venturafilms-226-509600,10,18 February 2015,"The Godfather is a prime example of a film by a genius who tells a story through his own perceptions and knowledge that prevails to be one of the greatest films ever made..The unflappable tenacity of the man the Director Francis Ford Coppola to display his vision of a time that is seated now in the American mainstream an imprint of Americana, the look, feel and archetype of a time incredibly captured on 35 mm...I have gone back in time to see this great film several times and with each journey I take whilst watching the film I am taken through the story of a mans view of our world and a time once where cities were governed by a darker underbelly of ruthless street thugs posing as upstanding citizens and living by a credo of Family love and death and violence. These kind of epics with their bold performances and matchless chemistry reach the mainstream few times in a lifetime and remain such forever in both the annals of history and realm of entertainment"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anton-6,10,13 October 2001,"Everybody said that this film was the best ever done so I have wanted to see this for years(and the other parts I shall soon see).So when I found out that it would come on DVD I planned to buy it,and so I did. And when I saw it I thought it was an masterpiece.Perfect in every ways. The whole cast acts excellent and Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for best leading role.It´s also a very beautiful epic and the music is fantastic.I almost forgot to write that the direction by Francis Ford Coppola is also excellent.Still it has done better films than ""the Godfather"" but it´s really a Masterpiece.If you don´t own the Godfather collection on DVD run out and buy it now.5/5"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zooropa-2,10,24 April 2005,"During a normal day in the life, a daughter is getting married, which should be the most proud time for a father. It should be the day when it is all about getting together with the family and enjoy the just married couple... yet Don Corleone has some business to attend to, and during this wedding he offers his help to many people, who needs justice the hard way. Vito Corleone has under-the-table-deals which are just as important to him as protecting his family. The opening scene is about twenty minutes long, where the Godfather setting is established. The raw criminal life of gangsters who must take care of the family as well as the family business. A great bunch of stories are entwined in this movie - stories about family(especially father and son), tradition, criminal life, power, all perfectly combined into one great story about the Godfather. It's well instructed, especially the scene where the Corleones are killing the leaders of the 5 families... it's a robotism, but with the sad church choir music and all the killings going on at the same time, it all seems pretty much like a requiem... Marlon Brando's performance as Vito is outstanding but so is Al Pacino as the son Michael. The movie is filled with great acting which includes Robert Duvall's work as Tom Hagen. The greatness about the Godfather is, that it's a perfectly combined story and very well directing as well! Francis Ford Coppola knows exactly how long a scene should last in order to give all the actors the time they need to show how they master their roles. This is not boring, but on the other hand very exciting as it gives the movie quite an artistic perspective. It goes from being a great movie into being beyond great.. It's a cultural and intelligent masterpiece that takes a lot of patience though but what art doesn't require patience?.... bad art!"

If somebody ever names me Godfather to their child, I'll be too tempted to give them a horse's head. Vito Andolini Corleone, his sons MIcheal, Santino,and Fredo, his friends Sal and Peter. What a collection of hooligans. This isn't a great movie.It's a perfect movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),duggie_666,10,12 February 2002,"the godfather is a timeless classic most ages can appreciate. the godfather is one of very few movies that have standed the test of time. the godfather is the best of the trilogy but the godfather pt II is very close but not just  the main reason for this is because Marlon Brando isn't in the second part  he is truely amazing in the godfather if he hadn't of won best actor oscar for it there would be alot of questions to ask.  this was Al Pacinos third movie the previous two not getting him any recognition he changed all this by giving the performance of his life, and if you think hes good in this see part II and even though most reviewers say that  part III is terrible i assure you it is not!  true it is not as good as the previous 2 but Al Pacino should be enough of a reason to watch part III  as he is, as always, amazing. so if you have seen the first Godfather but not the others then just buy the Godfather trilogy on d.v.d  thats what i did."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jdkraus,10,3 May 2006,"I have read the book years ago, but never saw the movie. I heard it was the greatest movie of all time and there was no criticisms. i saw this just last month, and it is a near perfect film! I have never seen such a powerful, believable, and moving movie since Schindler's List and Braveheart! The film captures the classical viewpoint of the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo in a very dark, but epic way, revealing the mafia as a manipulating and greedy domain of not just villains, but also of their families. The film is almost a family film in such a way that it is about family, the power of it, and that it should be loved and honored. Taht is one of the main reasons why this is such a glamorous film! The story takes place in the 1940s and 50s, and is about a mafia family called the Coreleone's who came from Sicily. They're a very powerful mafia in New York city led by an aging, persuasive man, Vito Coreleone played by the ultimate Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OttoVonB,10,3 June 2006,"The Godfather casts a long shadow over every single film represented on IMDb, to a point that creates impossible expectations, and frequent accusations of ""overrated"". Let that very subjective criteria be measured against IMDb's very transparent ranking logic: average popularity. Much like the Oscars, the IMDb top 100 might not be ruled by your number 1 film, but by the film the greatest number of people ranked very highly. If you free The Godfather from this weighty title, it still deserves a 10 by any standard."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mustafaoenal,10,16 January 2015,"One of my favorite movies, in conjunction with part II. I can't say much here, but one outstanding element is the thoroughly believable though dramatic transformation of Michael Corleone. How does one who has always steered totally clear of his family's mafia ways, is an ivy league graduate and has returned from WWII as a Marine war hero become a ruthless, murderous gangster? Coppola achieves this tragic fall with remarkable subtlety and skill. Now that his buddy Lucas is done with Star Wars, it's interesting to see that Darth Vader fell due to the same tragic flaw: desiring as much power as possible in order to keep his family safe - even if it means becoming a murderer. (The Godfather is an infinitely better film than any Star Wars flick, though I'm a sentimental fan for life.) The other element I find most compelling is Pacino's projection of intense power and charismatic strength. His quiet words are more terrifying than the yelling and machine gun of any action hero (or even of Tony Montana). I can't help admiring his character, even though he is a criminal. His performance is so intense and convincing, I actually can hardly watch Pacino in anything else. Music, cinematography, acting, dialog, etc. are all phenomenal. It is a near-perfect film and the greatest modern tragedy I've seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),blazesnakes9,10,27 November 2013,"Movies are made for a lot of reasons and can inflict human emotions to the audience. Some tend to be classics because a lot of people enjoyed the movie and raved about it. Others don't go far to be known. In my opinion, movies that are classics are going to stay for a long time. Movies that don't fare well will be forgotten. But, what about movies like The Godfather? Is that movie is going to be around for a long time? Absolutely. Is it for all generations to see? Absolutely. Without a doubt, The Godfather is the leader to all of the great movies. The movie is adapted from Mario Puzo's best-seller and it tells the story of a family. Vito Corleone is the head of his family. He is also the head of the family's business. His family deals with different situations that are dealt with in their own style and fashion. In other words, they are the Mafia. When Vito's son comes home from the war, he decides on his own behalf to not get involved in his family's business. Michael Corleone, Vito's son, decides to live his own life while his family deals with their own problems. But, when one of Vito's sons, Sonny, played by James Caan, is killed during a mob hit, Vito decides to take revenge against the people who killed his son. Meanwhile, Michael becomes aware of his surroundings and starts to see a downfall of his father's empire. His father is severely injured in the streets after being gunned down and Michael starts to wonder who's going to watch over the family. In other words, who's going to be the next godfather? As the movie progresses, I was suddenly starting to see a change being done to the movie and also to the movie industry. This rise and fall story is told very beautifully and is directed with a focused look at a world where family sticks together and carry out their jobs and fall down and suffer the consequences. This movie has a lot in store and has a lot of feeling about the underworld of the mafia. We even see that even though Michael does become who he is in the end, we know that for a fact that the choice was one that couldn't be refused. The Godfather is a film to be hailed. It's portrayal of the Italian mob is not stereotypical. Instead, the movie focuses on a family that is doused with honor, pride, lust and life. People do get hurt in these drastic situations and those wounds do hurt in a way that you've never felt before. For me, this film speaks louder than the words that are being said. It is more than a gangster movie. It is what the movies are meant to do, which is entertain us at its best and greatest. The performances by Marlon Brando is excellent. He really leads a very well-casted movie that include Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone, Robert Duvall, as the family lawyer, who is Irish and the supporting role of Diana Keaton as Pacino's love interest. All of the acting in The Godfather is phenomenal. This is the movie that made Al Pacino a star. He is that great of a legendary actor to star as Michael. Director Francis Ford Coppola said that in several interviews involving his film, he said that The Godfather was the hardest film to make. With a ballooning budget and a casting problem with the role of Vito Corleone, Coppola suffered most of the time and even was afraid he'll lose his job. In my opinion, he should be proud of the film he made. Even though it was troubling to make, in the end, it paid off. Not only being in the top 10 grossing films of 1972, but also allowing us to see a movie that's worth watching and worth looking at. It is also fill with style and power that in the end, we are starving to see it again. The Godfather took home 3 Oscars, including Best Picture and spawned 2 sequels. As a movie buff, all I can say is that The Godfather leads behind other classic movies like Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Casablanca. Like those 3 other movies, it's the power and story-telling that grabs us out of the movie theater and puts us into the spotlight with well-scripted characters and various stories that emerged out of the family. The sheer critical praise of The Godfather continues to seen and even though it's been 41 years since the film's release, this film isn't going to die. The epic scope and vision of this underworld is going to live on and keep this classic pumping. The Godfather is the best film of 1972 and yet, one of the greatest movies of all time. ★★★★ 4 stars."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),galnatrickerz,6,25 March 2013,"People say this movie is one or even the best movie of all time I can't really understand why. I did not go in for very high expectations so I thought that after I had watched this movie my mind would be blown but it wasn't and thats really sad. This movie was really original but it doesn't and it helps this movie a lot still this movie is very overrated. I have not read the book. This movie compared to The Dark Knight Trilogy is I'm sorry to say it but a joke. It's not really worth watching it feels like what was the purpose of this movie? To see the underworld? The last 15 minutes are the best thing in this movie but you really got to ask yourself is it worth watching a movie that is 175 minutes long for 15 minutes? The actors was outstanding but so are the ones in as an example The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception or Lord of The Rings Trilogy. When I was going to see Looper I came in with the same expectations but but my mind was blewn! Looper had a purpose but The Godfather didn't. Sorry to all of you who think that your going to see the best movie ever but this is not the one, go see Lord of The Rings Trilogy there you have a masterpiece!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Cybermage12,1,12 August 2003,"Ok, I'll admit, I liked the Godfather, but #1 movie of all time?  That is sickening!  A good movie is not a movie that is ""fun"", if it was, then #1 would be a bad James Bond movie.  Any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you MEANING outside of the theater, not a movie about false organized crime!  How the hell did this movie get #1 if it's just a movie about killing?  The only movie I can think of that should get #1 is American Beauty."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carthur10,10,18 August 2014,"It's ability to transcend the test of time, and it's perfect cinematic portrayal of an infamous subculture are what make this movie so highly regarded. The movie was so captivating and did such a good job of identifying the Italian American Organized Crime Sub-Culture that it actually became the handbook by which future generations of mobsters operated. I can't think of many movies that have had that kind of cultural impact. Brilliant production from start to finish! The show was cast perfectly helping to solidify it as a classic. Even today the movie is relevant and has provided a basis and format for movies about organized crime. Intensity of the scenes was key to the accurate portrayal of the life of a crime family."

It is considered the greatest movie ever made (and although it is not my favourite) it is rightly considered so because I can't pick out any faults in this movie. Everything from the acting (with a cast like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and so on) you cannot go wrong! Nino Rota's score is fantastic and superbly integrated into the film. Marlon Brando gives a powerhouse performance of a lifetime as the now infamous Don Vito Corleone and the music is now referred to as the quintessential mafia music."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gold_movies,10,19 March 2006,"I think that Godfather 1 is the best movie ever made. Along side Enemy at the gates, The good The bad and The ugly, Popillon,The Message  is one of the outstanding movies, but I can say that godfather 1 is the best.

Comon everyone have to admit Marlon Brando's performance in this film is one of the greatest performance ever in the film history. By the way the score is another element that adds to the greatness of this film, The only word to describe this film is 'EPIC' All characters fit in perfectly, the mood/tone is correct for every scene and all actors equally shows their talent fully in this film. The memorable moments such as the Don shooting scene, Sollozzo killing scene! concludes this film to be pure perfection!

To be fair there are a few negatives.  At times it is difficult to understand what Marlon Brando is saying.  Also, having read the book, there are some interesting characters and sub-plots that are hardly developed in either this move or the sequel.  The character of Luca Bracci was never fully appreciated in the movie and he appears almost to be a buffoon.  In the book he is an incredibly feared individual that had wiped out some competing mobs single handedly.  You could say he was the Michael Jordan of hitmen."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wolfcorleone,10,14 March 2005,"I don't know why,but since i know about myself i loved mob movies.There is something interesting in the way of a mafioso to the top,and his fall.So it is not a miracle,that The Godfather trilogy is my favourite movie. The Godfather trilogy is a magnificent saga about the Corleone family and it's way to the top of the American mob.Afcourse and their way into the high society of admired people.But,behind this story lies one more story,as complex as the first,about higher values,family,love and respect.It is very interesting to see Vito Andolini's(Marlon Brando) way from his departure from Sicily,where he was on the run because local boss Don Cicci wanted to kill him because he thought that Vito is going to take revenge on him for killing his father and brother,to New York's ''Litlle Itally'' where he is living like a bum.Although Vito had a really small wage,he bought a pear every day and brought it to his wife to show his love,respect and gratitude.Later,Vito became a very wise man and the king of the Mafia. God never gives without taking.Don Vito in one of his wars with the other families lost his oldest son,Sonny(James Caan).So, today we all know a old Mafia saying:For revenge always kill the brother. It means that you never kill the man that brought you harm,but you should kill someone that is closest to his heart.It will hurt more.On this way Vito's youngest son (Al Pacino) and his ''grandson'' (Andy Garcia) will lose their wives.And there is one more thing that the movie shows the best.What money can do to a man!When their parents die Michael kills Fredo because he let him down.Horrible,but logic."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),KevinFullerton1990,9,23 April 2009,"*****Spoilers Ahead***** 'The Godfather' is a film that everyone knows about. It is the type of film that is so heavily ingrained within popular culture that every reference, parody, and outright copy is almost a culture unto itself. It is because of this that even if you have not had the pleasure of viewing Francis Ford Coppola's master work, you feel like you have. It is also because of this that a surprising number of people never get around to watching 'The Godfather'. Afraid that they'll be entering a world of endless Mafia cliché and hackneyed dialogue, they steer clear of this gem of a film. A few days ago I was one of those people. Now - after picking up the box set for the meagre sum of fifteen pounds – I would count myself as one of the lucky portion of the population who has seen 'The Godfather'."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SweetJohnson2006,10,28 December 2007,"I love this movie! I will gladly be the first to admit, that I have always been fascinated by the Mafia, and that particular lifestyle... It's an incredible ride! It will deliver every genre of film you could possibly want: Action, Drama, Comedy, Suspense, and Romance... The performances in this movie by Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale are simply the best acting you will ever see... I've always said if I can't believe the actors in their roles, then I will not recommend the movie to someone, In The Godfather, Everyone performs their roles... Perfectly! I know this is a long movie, but trust me, I have seen it so many times, and it is the only movie that I've ever seen to keep my attention the entire running time."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),valgreet,10,11 August 2008,"Wow, this is a great film. Repeated (and I do mean repeated) viewings have not changed its power to fascinate and enthrall after all these years. Like the great Greek tragedies, Godfathers I and II just speak the essential truth about humanity and familial relationships in a way that everyone can relate to and can use to understand their own lives. Great art has the power to do that. All of the elements - screenplay, cinematography, acting, music - come together just about perfectly. Perhaps it is because of an accident of time and place and circumstance, like Casablanca, but it is hard to imagine this film being done any other way, or being remade by anyone else, with another cast. Truly one of the essential movies in the cinematic canon."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),u23,6,31 October 2006,"I watched this movie recently, and i am disappointed. I was expecting masterpiece, i was wrong. It is on the top, but i think it is highly overrated. The Godfather is definitely too long, some parts are absurd, like final scene when Mike tells his wife that he didn't kill his brother-in-law, and she believes him!!!!!! I was laughing and this is not a comedy. Music is bad, too many useless scenes. The Godfather is a good movie, but not brilliant, as many think. There are many better movies like: The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Lord of the Rings(1,2,3), Fight Club, etc. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),connor1982,4,2 June 2014,"What I don't understand is why so many think this is such a great film. The actors did great, but the whole story to me was boring. I like to see the bad guys get whats coming to them. I think a lot of the guys who watch this kind of idolize them and that's just sad to me. At least it seems that way. Maybe I just like my crime movies to have a more definitive hero. Someone I can root for to come out on top. There are mob/crime family movies I really like so I know its not just the genre I don't care for. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 10 is because the actors were good, otherwise I'd have given it a 1. This is just my opinion of course. I often disagree with critics and ratings so you should watch it and judge for yourself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rahman786,10,29 December 2011,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films to ever hit the screens. It is a film that teaches you all the possible lessons in life, having at the same time such a powerful and emotional background story.I have never felt such strong emotions from watching a film before as I did when I saw The Godfather, it takes you in it's world and grasps you by the neck, indulging you in a story that you forever wished you could be a part of yourself. The Godfather is what the true mafia is about, Francis Ford Coppola takes the term ""mafia"" and really put's it into context by showing us nearly every possible situation involved within the mafia and how it has it's affects on family and friends. To conclude, The Godfather in my opinion is the best film of all time and if you haven't yet seen it for some strange reason then please go and watch it, you will not be disappointed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vovazhd,10,10 January 2008,"The Godfather is placed near the top of any reliable best films list. It is an American classic based on Mario Puzo's novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It recounts the ascent of Michael Corleone to the head of his crime family, originally headed by his father, ""the Godfather"" Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito is played by Marlon Brando in a key performance, which actually does not amount to all that much screen time (at least, relative to the whole film). The majority of the film focuses on Michael and his acquaintances trying to sustain an empire that satisfies their vision of an American dream."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Madhu-Van-Paare,10,28 November 2014,"Easily Marlon Brando's best performance. James Caan's best performance, and Al Pacino steals the show. Al Pacino's performance is not as good as the one from Dog Day Afternoon, but still up there as his second best performance. Arguably Robert Duval's best performance ever. Off course we must mention Al Pacino's dear friend (also from Dog Day Afternoon), who plays his older brother Fredo, John Cazale; an amazing performance, that he will top in Godfather II. I also need to mention that Johnny Fontane, played by Al Martino, is most likely based on, or at least inspired by, Frank Sinatra... And we need to mention the iconic music, the only score that ever came close to Ennio Moricone's music. In fact the maestro, Ennio Morricone, performed that tune more then once. Some people call this movie the bible... That might be a bit cynical, but it simply is the most quoted movie ever. ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AlexanderOrtizJr,10,30 January 2015,"Highly recommend movie. A lot of action throughout the movie with a lot of it.To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. mafia and family life is superb in every department, writing, acting, directing, a highlight of Coppola's career as well as of New American Cinema.Vizzini was right: Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime.Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),corradobelfiore,10,25 November 2019,"The trilogy is an EPIC MOVIE. It depicts many real stories, real Sicilian family values, and what masterpiece truly is."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),riaz_ahmady,10,17 December 2011,"Godfather is the movie of the century and as far as i know it will stay at the top of the movie in another 5 to 10 century's.Since today I haven't seen a movie like Godfather. The story is too tragedy and it keeps you on watching the movie. The story takes you in the movie. They planning is too good! I have seen most of the mafia, police, tragedy and all of the same sort but in my opinion if you compare them to godfather, the highest will get 6/10 while Godfather gets 10/10. The main character of the movie ""Don Vito Corleone"" looks and act like a proper don. His personality and the way he talks is my favorite. Trust me when you watch the movie remember to notice how he talks and how he plans things. Hes a real G."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iman-faghih,10,13 January 2015,The film is undoubtedly one of the best films in cinema history as the father of the main reasons I think this is a wonderful director Coppola and unique game Marlow Brando and simplicity of the film. One of the best scenes in the movie The Godfather Death. The Godfather II and III as well as the integral of a good father of Fyml the number two and three are transferred. The only weakness of the film is that like a lot of movies and high-axis is the axis of indirect sex is not a crime. With Lpachynv The film also good but I think it adds a major reason for the continued presence of the father.Marlo Brando and AL pa chino is the best actor this film . in the end this film is very nice and in before died must watch .
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shotgunsmith2004,,10 April 2008,"""The Godfather"" is to my generation (those born in the 1950's) what ""Dr. Stranglove"" is to those born in the 1940's and what ""From Here To Eternity"" is to my parents generation (those born in the 1930's) or what ""Gone With The Wind"" was to those born in the 1920's. They are all four considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME by their generation!(They are all four historical dramas with plenty of realistic violence, insanity,love, hate, sex & bad language.) By the same logic there must be a ""greatest movie of all time"" to those born in the 1970's as well as those born in the 1980's. That would be an interesting list, what each generation considered the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME? What did people born in the 1910's consider the greatest movie of all time?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kademadouma,6,2 January 2020,"Very overrated and i waste 3h of my life watching this old movie..
I hate when somebody talk about the godfather's acting"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sheridan1341,1,3 August 2007,When I was in high school I took a cinema class and the teacher showed the Godfather I & II. I personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring. There was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way. If you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),esteban1747,9,15 October 2004,"Probably I have seen this film 3-4 times and always enjoyed it. The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jcanettis,10,29 August 2004,"I believe that there is little that need to be said about the ""Godfather"". A true masterpiece, whose characters has become legendary (who has not heard about Don Corleone), has been followed by an equally great sequel (not counting Godfather III which is a good movie but definitely belongs to a lower league than I and II), and has inspired and paved the road for other legendary mafia films (""Goodfellas"", ""Once Upon A Time in America"")."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),blairgallop7,10,21 October 2007,"One of,if not,the best movie of all time,The Godfather has it all in terms of drama,violence,etc.The thing that is very special about this movie is that it sets the gangster film archetype in concrete and would inspire future gangster greats such as Scarface,Godfather:Part Two and Three,Goodfellas,Carlito's Way,The Departed,etc.This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola which was adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name.The cast of this movie includes Marlon Brando as the iconic Don Vito Corleone,at the time newcomer Al Pacino as Vito's youngest son,Michael,James Caan as hotheaded Santino""Sonny"",Robert Duvall as Consigliere Tom Hagen,Diane Keaton as Michael's love interest,Kay Adams and John Cazale as Fredo Corleone.It would win the Academy Award for Best Picture,Best Actor-Brando and would additionally receive nominations for Best Supporting Actor-James Caan,Al Pacino and Robert Duvall.One of my favorite films and a crime classic.Bravo!Excellent!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Lt_Coffey_182,10,28 May 2006,"There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said already but that's not going to stop me praising this film. Simply put, The Godfather is one of the best films ever made and is often considered to be the best by many. For an explanation, it's impossible to pick any one reason as this is a near perfect film with all elements set perfectly in place."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),timotejlampeignjic,10,8 December 2019,"For me, this movie is definitely one of the best movies!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wrcong,10,8 February 2005,That two word summary captures my bottom line feelings about this film: simply extraordinary.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stanlee-ohikhuare,10,7 January 2015,"The godfather to me is the most intricately made, neo-realistic film ever. It is the singular film that inspired me to become a film maker. Everything about the movie, from the plot, score, lighting, cinematography and neo-realistic nature appeals to that part of me that craves for expression via film making. I particularly adore the way don corleone was lit throughout the movie. I also got the opportunity to see the behind the scenes footage shot by a fresh out of college guy and it gave me more insight into the thinking behind the final project. Finally, for a seemingly low budget movie; when the budget is compared to some other movies made in the same era, i must say it's a winner any day, anytime. Every time i conceive a new score or soundtrack for any of my movie projects, I always hear the soundtrack of the godfather i my head."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),skinny_pigeon,10,31 May 2010,"Undoubtedly the best picture of all times and perhaps the only movie without a plot hole in the history of film making. Not a single scene or a line is unnecessary in the whole film. The direction, casting, plot, music, cinematography, acting, lines, everything seems just perfect. Al Paccino and Brando simply were born for their roles. But please don't bother to watch this epic film if you do like movies with extreme violence, sense less killing, unnecessary car chases and the hero fighting ten people at a time with bare hands. This film is totally in a different league, you simply cannot compare it to any other crime or gangster movie ever made. The way Al Paccino transformed himself from a subtle, educated and sophisticated Italian American into a typical Italian mafia boss, is without a doubt one of the best performances of all times."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BobisBob,,9 August 1998,"now i've seen stupid movies, but this one was the stupidest most pathetic movie i've ever seen.  i dont understand how people can like it.  too much violence. i recommend you dont waste your time watching this abomination.  i give this a -9 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),babygurl061485,6,24 April 2006,"The scene at the funeral Michael is sitting down talking and the woman appears on his shoulder. When he goes to stand up, another woman appears on the same side. It is very quick and the movie can be paused to see it clear. If you have a DVD you can pause it and fast forward very slow and you can see the first woman open her eyes and smile. Has anyone ever noticed this or is it apart of the movie. If you have not please watch the movie and tell me anything you know about it. It was very weird and my family and i just noticed it last night and we really would like to know what it might be or mean. We don't know if it was a mistake made in the movie or if the woman was meant to be in it. If anyone has any information on this please let us know. If you look very close you can tell that the woman you see at first is different from the second. It is very easily mistaken for the sunlight. She is there through the whole conversation but not as clear when Michael leans forward and she is on the dark part of his jacket. When you watch this make sure the whole time your watching the funeral scene you watch it slow as possible. It very easy to miss. PLease comment when you see it!!!! Thank you"

What is exceptional about this movie is that I have watched it at least 10 times and I may watch it 100 times again and I am sure that I will be enjoying watching it like a first time. I believe strongly that, this movie has a special place for everyone. Godfather makes clear the distinctions between conflict of interests and the power of mafia."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),agmoldham,9,23 December 2003,This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),buck4821,10,30 September 2012,"The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the ""family business."" The ""family business"" is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk ""business,"" they often use the phrase, ""It's not personal, it's just business."" They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),niamh-94,10,1 August 2011,"There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. The acting is superb. The story all consuming. You wonder, will you ever be able to watch another film without using The Godfather as a bench-mark. You won't be able to help yourself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LOK-1,10,29 October 2002,"I know how annoying it is with long comments so: GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE! It´s the best movie ever made and nobody can make a better one! The actors are completely wonderful and Coppola has created a masterpiece! The sequels are great, but this one is the best part of the trilogy! Some people may find the movie slow, but can they say that the story is bulls**t? Not likely... 10/10!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Red-Barracuda,10,4 October 2011,The gangster is the unacceptable face of the American myth. He is the antithesis of the western hero; he is not society's saviour but its public enemy. The 1930's gangster film was rooted in headlines of the day; it was a resolutely contemporary genre. The first gangster cycle responded to the restrictions of Prohibition and the effects of the Depression. These gangsters defied harsh economic realities and in doing so became anti-heroes of the people. Their defiance of authority made them relevant and popular; they were the dark side of the American dream.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pmtelefon,8,1 February 2021,"There is greatness in ""The Godfather"". There is no denying that. I've seen it a bunch of times. There are too many great moments to mention but there are a few dull moments too. Maybe it's because it's always on tv. Maybe it's because I've hear quotes from this movie for the past 49 years. Maybe I've read too much about the making of this film. I don't know. It's still a really good movie. Don't get me wrong. It's just that I don't think the total package is as great as I used to think."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),terry-116,,16 September 2001,"i cannot understand how anyone enjoys this film.it is ridiculous,overacted,and the dialogue goes beyond description. i can safely state that it is the worst film i have ever seen.how has this rubbish become no1.the shawshank,yeah, a great film, but the godfather. i think that its one of those films that have become a trend.people who have watched it and hate it are scared to say so. the thing is awful."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TyRuski,6,3 January 2004,"This is a great film. And it is also the most over-hyped film of all time. I enjoyed the script and the acting. A little slow in some spots, and it failed to grab my attention emotionally. But it was a good 8/10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Peter Elefant,3,17 October 2001,"I noticed that this was the best rated film in this place a couple of months ago, so naturally, I decided to give it at shot. But I just don't get what attracts you folks to it?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),krumski,10,1 February 2000,"What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times. This is one of those movies that just holds you in thrall from beginning to end, with no let up in interest or involvement - an amazing feat under any circumstance but almost unheard of for a three-hour movie! As such, it's interesting to compare this with more recent epic-length films of today. A couple years ago, on its 25th anniversary re-release I saw this in the theater on the same day I saw ""The English Patient"". The difference in the two films was just amazing. The English Patient wasn't bad or anything, it's just that it was way too long for the story it told; a good 90 minute-to-2 hour premise was padded out with gorgeous but pointless scenery, an unnecessary subplot, and a shooting and acting style which emphasized dragging things out just for their own sake. The Godfather, by comparison, crams every single minute of its running time with richness, characterization, intrigue, etc. - so much so that, for me, the film actually seems SHORTER than its running time would lead you to believe. There's so many movies that could learn from this - movies that want to be epic length to inflate the importance of their subjects, but just arent' interesting enough to hold us for that long. Many films are guilty here, from Titanic to The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Green Mile - even such ""great"" films as Lawrence of Arabia and (yes) Shindler's List use their lengths more as endurance tests (i.e. if you can't stay interested through the whole thing than you must be somehow boorish or unfeeling) and as proofs that the directors just became so enamored of their subjects that they couldn't bear to take anything out than as necessary for the telling of their stories. Sadly, I must say that, in my opinion, even The Godfather Part II falls victim to this tendancy - definitely one of the most overrated and unnecessary sequels of all time."

If i need to explain this movie with one Word, it would be amazing. Anyways. I saw this movie at 17 years old. And i was amazed how good the movie was. And my mouth hust dropped open at the end of the masterpuice. You really should watch this movie. And the other two movies. To sum up, if you have the time and if you are into criminal movies this is the one. This isa masterpice and this is te perfwct movie. Neverthless i loved the caracter Don andMichael a lot! So watc this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ForReal84,9,18 September 2003,"The Godfather is one of the best films ever to be made; it has everything that makes a movie worth watching. One of the great aspects of this film is the fact that it is watchable over and over again. The story line is good, no excuse me great, all of the actors from the awesome Marlon Brando, to the underrated Talia Shire turn in superb performances.    The story centers on Don Vito Carleone (Brando) and his family. James cann turns in a standout performance as Sonny. Diane Keaton's role is small but she plays the character of Kay perfect. The Godfather has one of the most gripping storylines that has come across in any film. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking. While there is no such thing as a perfect film, because someone will always find something they don't like in a movie, The Godfather is a film with few flaws. There is action, some comedy, a little romance, and tons of drama. The Godfather is about one family and how they will and do kill for each other. It's a movie that at the center is about what we all do to survive in this world. At most it's a film that will make its viewer escape their everyday reality and step into a wild that hopefully most of us haven't become accustomed to. 3.9 out of 4 stars. (A)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Nama_mikenish,10,13 August 2009,well i wont be the only one who has given 10 to the godfather. i consider it as the greatest movie in the world. performance by Marlon Brando is far too better than what it was in on the waterfront.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tylerdurden111111,10,1 June 2005,"Francis Ford Coppola has done some brilliant work, but he has never been better than in The Godfather and the sequel. This is a complex story set in New York City in the era just after World War II. It involves the Corleone Family, an Italian-American family that has thrived in the U.S. as the father of the clan (Vito Corleone/Marlon Brando) turned to organized crime to gain his slice of the American Pie. I won't get into the plot too much for fear of invoking the ""spoiler"" rule, but the essential plot revolves around a dispute between the Corleone Family and one of the other crime families over Corleone's unwillingness to engage in the illegal drug trade."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),enrique-povo,9,9 March 2008,"This is one of my favorite movies. However, the last time I saw it, I was disappointed to spot a serious flaw in the plot that I never realized before. It seems that not many people have. The movie is still so great, that this blunder is forgivable. But, at least for me, it will never be the same again. If you read any further, you may be as disappointed as I was."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wouter_decree,6,4 October 2019,"Why oh why is this 'the second best movie ever' according to imdb? Do we really need to sit through 2,5 hours of nothing to see for just a little bit of action in the last 10 minutes?
Gangster movies can be entertaining, just ask Scorsese. This was nearly 3 hours of trying to keep awake just because of the high rating.
Thanks but no thanks.
Hopefully the second one will be better but I have my doubts after seeing this one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marshall-dan784,1,26 August 2023,"Certainly the most massively overrated movie of all time. I finally saw it today, out of sheer curiosity, after avoiding it for so long.

Beautiful pictures, locations and the soundtrack that touch your feeling and you will never forget it.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay structured by Mario Puzo, The Godfather is an American crime film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of a fictional New York crime family of Italian descent. The story primarily is centered on Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) and his transformation from a family outsider to the apparent heir to the title that is The Godfather, initially held by Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando). "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ibringkaliswag,10,2 September 2013,Have you ever questioned yourself as to why we are here? 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nunoaraujoduarte,10,17 December 2011,"One of the most seen movies of all time. Very few are those who haven't seen it or those who don't value it. The Godfather came to life in 1972 by the hands of Francis Ford Coppola transferring Mario Puzo's novel into the screen. It stars Marlon Brando (Don Corleone), Al Pacino (Michael Corleone), Diane Keaton (Kay), between others. The plot describes one of the five families of organised crime in New York around the late 40s and the first half of the 50s, the Corleones, more specifically the transition of power from Don Corleone to his son, Michael. Marlon Brando has one of the best performances I've seen, if not the best. It's amazing how he managed to incorporate the old gangster. Many people appreciate more his way of talking, this is not what makes it unique though, try to notice his facial expressions and you'll see it. Al Pacino also comes in great form but falls to second layout because of Brando's marvel. Coppola confines himself to the family and mixes it with the sheer and simple life that gangsters try to attach to their family, but many times fail to. Godfather is a great movie, probably the best related to mafia you've seen and will ever see, with many other unsuccessfully attempts movies (though strangely over-rated) such as Scarface, but that is a whole different story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sebastiannils1,10,28 December 2001,One of my absolute favorite films of all time. A masterpiece without any compare in its genre. Please note that there is not one detail to complain about in this film. As much as I love Part 2 the original is in a class for itself. 10 out of ten .. no doubt.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OfficialPaul,10,5 May 2013,"One of the best films ever. After winning an Oscar for Patton, Francis Ford Coppola became notable in Hollywood. The Godfather, Francis Ford's masterpiece, places him on the map as a respectable director. The direction was great by Coppola and the adapted screenplay by Coppola and Puzo was amazing. The wedding scene in the beginning introduces the characters and shows their importance."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tafakjia-211-755107,10,13 January 2015,"For me.. This is the best movie ever.. A great story, super stars actors plus awesome acting.. It shows deep inside the world of Mafia in Italy and how it moves to New York (USA) early 1930th.. The way Don Vito rolled the Mafia (including all families) and how he was at one side killing and smuggling for the Mafia (Family) benefits, he was on the other side helping (Poor) people to have what they are looking for!! Don Michael is an excellent story too, the realistic man who was serving in US Army during WW2 1945, turned to be at the critical time to unify his family killing all enemies and keeping them all under his umbrella as a new Godfather! I strongly recommend watching this movie.."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aaa18-92-929367,10,28 August 2014,"This movie change everything, it has great actors and good screenplay is the best movie ever. If you still don't see it you must to. But the only thing I found is this movie is for men more than women. Is a little violent so I think is why many women doesn't like it like men. I would like to tell that this movie is based in a book named The Good Father and the book is so much interested and the story is longer and complex that shows in the movie, still the movie is the best movie you can see. So I recommended to watch it is you still don't do it. And the soundtrack is the best Coppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including the main theme, ""Speak Softly Love""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),arthurclay,,1 October 2004,"That I've seen anyway and I have seen more movies than most people except Siskel and Ebert. What else do you want me to say? Marlon Brando and Al Pacino give the best performances imaginable and the best of their respective careers as Don Vito and Michael Corleone, father and son who shall we say do not share the same frame of mind when it comes to the family biz. Don Vito is grooming his oldest son Santoro aka Sonny (James Caan) to take over from him and be the boss of the most powerful crime family in New York yet dotes on his second son Michael and sees him as destined for greatness. However, Michael, having returned from Army Service in WWII wants nothing to do with his father's illegitimate empire yet forces beyond his control cause him to become embroiled in its dirty politics despite his sincere attempts to steer clear of it. Attempted assassinations and murders quickly ensue and threaten to destroy Michael and his family that he loves. This masterpiece of art and cinema deals with many themes: love, honor, sacrifice, betrayal, and power are some of them. The central and most important one is FAMILY and that is the focus of the whole story. If the viewer doesn't understand that they will never understand this film at all. And that is why I and so many others believe this is the greatest movie ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jwaterworth,7,27 May 2001,"Some memorable sequences, in particular a string of assassinations intercut with the family at church, but too many overly long scenes.  To me the film seems disjointed, and is let down by poor central performances (yes poor) by Brando (hammy), Pacino (stiff) and Keaton (invisible)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mcginleysean,1,25 June 2018,"It was the most boring film I've ever forced myself to endure in my entire life! I tried to tell myself it was good to be a part of the hype surrounding it but I just couldn't justify ever telling another soul to watch this movie. The boringness combined with characters that, I for one could not tell the difference between, being so unremarkable led for the biggest snooze fest of a film viewing ever! I don't understand the hype and personally it annoys me that this takes the #2 spot away from other incredible films!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),heisenberg12,8,28 February 2021,"The Godfather has great scenes, classic characters, classic dialogue, and an amusing look into the Italian mafioso, but it's just a tad bit too long to be perfect, in my opinion as a new viewer. There were many scenes that were riveting and performances that were, at times, mesmerizing, but I just feel like it is a little overrated."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),higherall7,10,2 May 2012,"Now I have seen 'THE GODFATHER' and its sequels a number of times and can even recite the dialog of whole scenes word for word. I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LazySod,10,28 September 2007,All right! Let me start by admitting that I should have watched this a long ago instead of waiting until now. Just never got around to it. The Godfather is probably one of those few films that everyone that has ever watched a film has at least heard about. The story of the aged leader of a mob family that transfers his powers to his son intermixed with the lives of the family members and their actions.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ROCKAFELLA71,10,19 December 2007,"I am an avid gangster film collector. The Godfather is my favorite movie. I watch all three every six months. My mother introduced me to this when I was a teenager in the 80s and I was hooked. Paccino is my favorite actor and I think up until the mid 90s he was the best character actor who ever lived in his error. Mario Puzzo did a great rendition of the book although when you read the book there are some differences as there always is. Mike was that ruthless cunning boss who would not let anything go, even if it was his own brother! You can't help but wonder if his character was based on Carlo Gambino who was also cunning in how he worked his family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hanish-lamba,10,25 November 2014,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. its basically the story of the old generation of the mob being taking over by the new younger generation. great performances are done by all . the story telling is pretty well done all be it there are some slow downs where things seem they drag on a bit to long and gets a little dull. for the most part though its a entertaining story that will be watched for years to come .It's such amazingly well-acted, well- written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rami_11,10,1 June 2008,I see this outstanding film for the 3rd time in my life..and it's totally PERFECTION..i can't say this film is my favorite of all time..i really can't..but my favorite actor is definitely Marlon Brando..
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Kakueke,10,20 September 2001,"The Godfather is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and the acting performances of Marlin Brando as Vito Corleone and James Caan as Sonny match that comment (Al Pacino is also good, but they have the edge).  The first two-thirds of the movie is definitely better, but the last third does its job in finalizing Mike's evolution into a Mafia chief."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nuhc,10,16 April 2008,"I don't know how many times I've seen this film, but it's one of those movies I can just sit down and watch again & again. Even though I know what's going to happen in every scene, it just keeps my attention every time I see it. The acting is outstanding, the story line is very well written, and it just has all those moments that, even though you've seen the movie before, you want to see them again. Like, for instance, when the movie mogul wakes up to find his prized horse's head in his bed. Just thinking of the horror of that actually happening to someone, you know he's not going to go against the Godfather's wishes. And the moment Michael pulls the trigger to kill the drug kingpin and the police captain which means he is no longer an innocent bystander and is fully ""in."" This movie has so many mini-climaxes like this which eventually lead to the finale in which Michael rises to the top."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),movie_ape,7,23 October 2020,"Another oddity in my collection, it is an overrated piece similar to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Schindler's List' although much more watchable I have to say. In the end there are too many ridiculous scenes and poor acting that undersells the overall arching plot."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bjkhimself,10,30 December 2007,"This should have won the acadamy award for best movie ever made. It has awesome action. I think that everybody did a great job on it. Marlon Brandon deserved the Oscar he won. He did a great job on his role. My favorite character in the movie is James Cann's role ""Sonny Corleone"". He did a great job in it. Especially when he kicked Carlo's ass. Al Pacino also did a good job in it. I really liked him in this. It is my favorite role of his(this and Scarface).I believe Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. Francis Ford Copppla did a great job. He brought in great acting assemble for this movie. He pretty much started Al Pacino's amazing career. Everybody remembers James Cann for his role, and the same for Marlon Brando's role. CHICA CHICA YEAH!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jldmp1,9,22 April 2006,"When tackling something of the sheer breadth of Puzo's novel, the screenplay problem becomes not what should be included, but what should be left out."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ragosaal,10,5 September 2006,"The Godfather stands as the ultimate film in the Mafia and gangsters genre. I don't think it could have been improved in any way. A very interesting story, tremendous action scenes, great special effects, outstanding performances, strong direction, not a single sequence in excess, a good soundtrack, perfect timing, details carefully attended to, well defined characters, etc, etc."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),freaky_dave,10,12 April 2006,"Yes I'm talking about The Godfather. It's one of the best motion pictures out there. I don't know if it should be at #1 on IMDPs top 250, but it definitely belongs in the top 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Michal-14,9,2 October 1998,"This movie was great. The movie had a great cast and an amazing story line. It showed how a person can really change after something really bad happened in their lives. I was in a history class last year and I never realised how horrible these years really were(with the gangs, like Al Capone) This movie was really great!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kyle-43792,9,26 November 2019,Coppola's finest movie and arguably Pacino's finest performance. The high point of the 'New Hollywood'.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jake-law123,8,6 June 2010,"Living up to the edge of this film is what each mob film stands for. This is the film that started the mob genre in my opinion. A classic story in its own mind, and a perfect hit to cinema. Based off the saga by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola's first chapter of the epic legacy that lives on as The Godfather. The tale of a crime organization in the 1940s that go into a struggle for power when the leader is shot and hospitalized in a conspiracy, though continuously tended by his trusted sons, played by some of the now famous actors ever, including James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino. Terrificly follows the novel, with solid editing and setting, and outstanding performances by everybody. Fits elements that put you into the shoes of a true mobster, dealing with real mandatory things in a crime family, jobs, deaths, and deals. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone is a magnificent performance that really gets into the character of a true mob leader, making offers people can't refuse. Coppola's best work ever, and one of the greatest films ever made!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Anotej,6,14 August 2023,"The Godfather is indeed a timeless classic, as many critics and audiences have agreed. It is a film that explores the themes of family, loyalty, power, corruption, and violence in a captivating and realistic way. It features some of the most memorable performances, scenes, and dialogues in cinema history, as well as a masterful direction by Francis Ford Coppola and a haunting score by Nino Rota. The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made, and has influenced countless filmmakers and genres."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),genaandherquill,5,29 May 2020,"The Godfather depicts Italian and American cultures accurately almost. Nothing is too Hollywoodised about this film. Characters are authentic in their actions. Which made me feel immersed. Vito Corleone is the cunning, adaptable, quietly assertive, violent, tactful, and relatively practical strategist of the Corleone family. Michael Corleone is the unpredictable, emotional, cautiously hesitant, rebellious, intense, and secretly romantic son of the Corleone family. Sonny Corleone is the simple, aggressive, straightforward, religious, popular, and loudly assertive son of the Corleone family. Connie Corleone is the pampered, very emotional, girly, materialistic, least harmful, and vulnerable daughter in Corleone family who is treated as a small instrument for the Corleone patriarchs' political game. Kay Corleone is the emotionally intelligent, protective, quiet, careful, lady-like, and religious mother of the Corleone family. Carmela Corleone is the religious, kind, fearing, traditional, emotional, and diplomatic mother of the Corleone family. Tom Hagen is the analytical, opportunistic, tactful, quietly emotional, loyal, and financially supportive lawyer of the Corleone family. Despite the hype from this film, I had an impossible time liking any of the characters in this film. Everything has a slow pace until this film's ending. The Godfather's funeral scene for the Vito has characters with so many black clothes... Also, Carmela has the wrong accent here because of slight inaccuracies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),seangordon,10,4 January 2008,"This is my personal favorite movie of all time. It's just perfect. I actually hate to give it 10 stars (because there's no such thing as perfect), but I haven't a choice. It's just perfect. If you hate this movie...well, then, that's fine. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. The settings are amazing, as are the camera angles, and the acting has no spots. The only thing imperfect about this movie is the character Santino. I just hate him. I'm glad he died. Critic's Star Amount: 4 (out of 4) Stars My Rating: 4 (out of 4) Stars You should watch it. It's just perfect. THere are few movies that can even compare to this. I just suggest this...if you only like the film because of the bloody scenes, then you should watch Pulp Fiction."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lastliberal-853-253708,10,21 September 2011,"This isn't the first time I have seen this film, but circumstances have given me a chance to see it in a new light."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zardoz-13,10,10 June 2013,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" truly qualifies as the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, ""The Godfather"" received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, ""The Godfather"" cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, ""The Godfather, Part II"" surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gurbanzada,10,3 December 2019,"The remarkable movie was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out. ""The Godfather"" himself is the central character in the drama."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),momohund,8,28 March 2005,"I know because I knew a mob guy. This is Hollywood's glorification of the worst possible life to choose. Phenomenal acting, but the life of a mob guy is violent and depraved (and often broke). The most realistic mob movie I have ever seen is Donnie Brasco. This is what mob life is really like. Mob life is about a million miles from being romantic. Carlito's Way is another realistic (more or less) look at street crime life. you watch this movie for the phenomenal acting, not for realism in any way. Hollywood loves to capitalize off stories of gangsters, glorify it up a bit, and package it as if it were real. What's real is busting your hump, not making enough in a month so you have to sell dope, and wondering if there is a gun at your head every second of the day. to be honest, I'd rather sell staplers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sonic_Ocean,10,16 May 2013,"I had a rough time watching The Godfather, because all the universal acclaim was completely clouding my judgement on the movie, because instead of being able to watch the movie with clarity, all this time I was looking at the opinions of the general public as the basis of finding clear reasons why to like this movie. I know everyone praises the performances, the film's structure, and every subtle nuance, but listening to those opinions gave me the idea I should be looking at these details so I will see why this movie is so great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),philthegreatone-786-63058,10,1 August 2010,"Where do I start, I shall start with the script. First of all it is flawless. Vito Corleone is being forced to start dealing in drugs from another family. He decides drugs is a dirty business. Then he finds out it's a bad idea because he gets shot... don't worry he didn't die.. not yet anyway. Michael his son decides to take care of him while he is the hospital..this in turn leads Michael to decide he wants to be part of the family business. He gets a sucker punch from a crooked cop. That leads to him being mad so the family want revenge. He meets them at a restaurant and for those of you who have seen the film.. you know what happens. Anyway Michael goes into hiding in Italy.. he then comes back years later and marries his old sweat heart Kay. He is now the boss of the family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JasonMorciglio,10,13 October 2013,"The title says it all, I saw it by the first time four months ago and then I couldn't help seeing the whole trilogy.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DavideGrosso,10,5 January 2015,"The film masterpiece of the century . Set in the old New York , is a mix of where the center of it all is the Sicilian Mafia . Or rather , of Sicilian origin . The figure most stereotypical Italian of that time , becomes the protagonist in The Godfather . Movies with a few smudges , shot in close contact with Mario Puzo , author of the book , and after all inspired by a story that seems real . But the extraordinary nature of the film lies in the cast , the consecration of Marlon Brando , and the "" launch "" of artists like Al Pacino , Robert De Niro and again , Robert Duvall . In short , the good old Francis saw us right . The film legend. The same Italian dubbing is impeccable in almost all his version even if in the heart , keep the dubbing of Amendola to the voice of Michael Corleone . You could add so much , but given the affection I feel for the film but would only idolatry same . Excellent and for me it's a pain to see it - here on IMDb - only "" second"" for users . But 100 of Metascore suggests much ... Kiss the hands !"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),godfather_rulles,10,29 January 2015,"One of the greatest movie i've ever seen if not the best. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando at their best. I can say that the first time i saw this movie, i taught it was the best experience of my life. The Godfather Part Two was equally as good as the first and The Godfather Part Three was good also but not quite at the first two. I heard many critics saying that The Part Three ruined the Trilogy but i don't agree, i liked it very much. I would give it 9.5 and 10 for the first two. The direction,picture, story, cast, acting all are perfect and that's why this film deserves the maximum grade. For all those who have not yet seen it, i strongly recommend to see it as soon as possible!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Christian_Dimartino,10,24 June 2013,"For years, I never wanted to see The Godfather because something always told me it was slightly overrated. Film fanatics have praised The Godfather (and it's sequel) as two of the best films ever made, and I could just never understand what could be so good about it. So, last year, I felt it was time to finally give the trilogy a go. And you know what? Everyone truly is right. It really is one of the best films ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),classicalsteve,10,19 February 2011,"The opening title and scene of ""The Godfather"" is one of the most striking in cinematic history. The lone trumpet invoking the tragic melody which has become so synonymous with this film is the equivalent of the tenor voice from an Italian opera, lamenting the loss of a loved-one in song, similar in style to a theme by Puccini or Verdi. Strangely, this sort of aria would have occurred towards the end of a traditional opera, usually at the death of the leading lady. But here the grieving music begins the story, as if tragic moments have already occurred, although they will continue to occur, a fundamental part of the story which is to follow. The beginning of the film is in actuality the middle of the larger epic of the Corleone family in America."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),werefox08,10,14 April 2012,"Francis Ford Coppola was 33 years old in 1972. That was the year of The Godfather. Coppola raised the bar---in relation to directing a movie. Things in movie land would never be the same. This was a great craftsman at work...and The Godfather became a land mark movie. Other films would be compared to the real thing, and very few got anywhere near this original Classic. Its now 40 years later, and were still waiting for a real challenger. Of course--its not going to happen. A movie like The Godfather could never be made today. We have directors who don't care to even try !! I understand that. It would require vision and a rich talent that skips several generations. It was Coppola who refused to back down when the studio brass wanted Ernest Borgnine for the lead role. He demanded Brando. He got Brando. Brando was great. This is one of those rare movies where all the planets align-----and everything works perfectly. Acting, screen play, music, etc.etc. Hell....even the best boy was the best, best boy in history !!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brianrorr,7,30 March 2024,"Good directing & great acting. But I think the movie could have done a much better job explaining Michael's motivations for not wanting to be in the family business, then becoming ruthless to consolidate power, and lastly why the hell was Kay so stupid to marry Michael & at the, seemingly believe Michael's lie that he didn't have his brother-in-law killed. In general, I wanted more history and explanation for the conflicts between families and between the Corleone children. Like why wasn't Sonny resentful towards Michael for not having to be in the family business but benefitting somewhat from it. Overall still enjoyable but lacking meaning amongst the 3 hours the movie took to tell its story. I ask myself, what was the point of the movie and Michael's actions."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Adriane,10,10 December 1999,"I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DarthVoorhees,10,27 March 2005,"First seeing The Godfather you'll probably have a good idea of what it is about a Mafia family.It is never mentioned as a Mafia film,and I do not believe the word Mafia is used in the film.For the Corleone family its a part of their business and lives.We know what the Corleone's are doing is evil and wrong,but The Godfather isn't told from our point of few it is told from the point of few of The Corleone family.With understanding this we are able to understand the characters more,and have sympathy for them.Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is a respectable man,he is offered to get into the drug business and he says it is wrong.The audience of course know that Vito is a cold hearted killer,but he comes across as a sad man.A crucial establishing scene in the beginning of the movie,has an undertaker asking Vito for justice,Vito says that he will receive it,but he will ask him a favor in the future.Vito is gunned down and is sick the rest of his life,his son Sanito ""Sonny"" Corleone takes his Father's place.Sonny is betrayed and gunned down in a violent war.A sad Vito comes in to the Undertaker asking his favor,clean up his body so his mother doesn't have to seem him like this.The story of The Godfather does not belong to Vito Corleone though he only plays a part in it.The Godfather is the story of the transfer of Vito's empire to his other son Michael.Michael is actually a decent guy,he has a girlfriend he plans to wed,and is a war hero.Michael in tears tells his Father he will be there for him next to his hospital bed.Michael kills the men who set-up his father.Vito even tells Michael he didn't want a life of crime for him,he wanted him to become something more.Through the course of the movie Michael becomes a man possibly worse than his father,he is a tragic figure you feel for."

The acting is fantastic, the score is excellent, the writing is great, and the cinematography is beautiful. When people think perfection in film making they usually either think ""Citizen Kane"" or this. It is expertly told story that spans through many years. The characters are great, and the relationships they have feel real. The story unfolds excellently, and by the time it is over you felt like you were part of the film. It is without a doubt the most influential crime drama ever made. This film is pure artistry at its finest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Eternality,10,18 August 2010,"Rarely can it be said that a film is genre-defining, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The romanticism of the Mafia is so vividly portrayed that one can't help but fall in love with the film, and the Corleone family. Well-known for its authentic visuals and the occasional sudden brutal bloody violence, The Godfather earned rave reviews worldwide upon its release, and certainly deserved its success."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Marc_Israel_365,10,27 May 2012,"Right from the initial ever-so-slow zoom into a terrified sit down with Don Corleone, we are baptized into the family by means of respect and, more pointedly, fear. You are set up and then walking the fine line between victim and family throughout. Quoted ad infinitum, the story itself is quite involved and is only topped by the frenetic ending. Dark and hypocritical, this is a convoluted ride to places better left on the big screen (which we now all have at home).Brando, Pacino, Duval and James Caan all deliver most convincingly, while the other actors, or soldiers (if you will) carry out their orders dedicatedly. Frances Ford Coppola struck cinema gold with the Mario Puzo best seller!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ryuakamrvengeance,8,7 March 2007,"Let me start by saying that I didn't particularly enjoy the Godfather. I found the film too slow paced, and James Caan was extremely irritable. Vito took FOREVER to recover, and when he did he choked it not long later."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chriskevingibson,10,28 November 2014,"There are many reasons that I say that The Godfather is the greatest movie that I have ever seen. For one, though it was made in the 70s, 1972 to be exact, it feels very modern. It's truly a timeless classic. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed and co-wrote the film, did an amazing job in the making of this film. The screenplay, which was co-written by Mario Puzo who also wrote the book of the same name, is the best that I have heard in any movie. Then there is the acting, which I think is not only the best ensemble of acting in a movie, but also that Marlon Brando, who in my opinion is one of the all-time greatest actors, put on the best performance in the role of Don Vito Corleone than any other actor did for any movie and any character. It is incredible to watch. There is no question why he won the Oscar for best actor, as well as the film winning for best adapted screenplay and for best picture. A must watch for any movie lover. It's ""an offer you can't refuse""."

Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),deanofrpps,10,29 April 2006,"Based on Mario Puzzo's book, The Godfather translated to the screen is an American masterpiece in the study of management and command. As a serious film it is one of the few American films which rises above syrupy American romantic comedy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jfarms1956,8,5 April 2013,"Excellent adult move. Love the music. I could have watched this all day long. Perfect length, if anything too short. Marlon Brando really defines the role of an Italian mafioso patriarch. I permanently learned the phrase, ""make them an offer they can't refuse."" Al Pacino gives another brilliant performance as the son who get drawn into his father's business, bit by bit. Then, Al Pacino becomes his father to continue his work. Al Pacino's character becomes even more ruthless a godfather than Marlon Brando. Robert Duvall, the family lawyer, gives a brilliant performance as one who at first comes off like a lamb but is really a lion in disguise. Diane Keaton plays a predictable character but gives an OK performance. The musical score is memorable. Just thinking about the movie brings to mind the musical score second to the character, the Godfather played by Marlon Brando. So powerful!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maryannlorient,7,25 June 2014,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),b-unit13,4,28 February 2009,"I watched this movie, trying not to set my hopes too high, after everything i had heard about THE GODFATHER. I think its overrated. It's an OK story. But i do not think that this movie should be worshiped the way it is. I think most people say its the greatest movie of all times, Because someone said to those people that it was the greatest movie of all time. I on the other hand found it so boring. So completely overrated and just simply SO boring that i hope never to see the other episodes of this movie. I in fact pray my children in the future will never have to see such a bad movie. Im sorry to say these thing and sound like a hater. But i really just do not agree with you and other who find this movie so magnificent. But i found this movie very bad apart from ill make him an offer he cant refuse story. Other than that i found this movie a mistake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PartialMovieViewer,10,17 May 2016,"So this movie is only number two out of 250 of the greatest movies ever made – whatsa-matta wid u? Dis movie should be numba one; along wid ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" Yeah – dats right, dey all gotta be numba ones; numba twos is for losers. Time to make offers dey can't refuse; clean da horse-heads out a-da bed and load up dat ole John J. Bartek moving van – we gotta settle dis – once and for all. OK, maybe I am going a little over the top, but before the Corleone family hit the cinemas, there really wasn't much spattering screens that defined what went on behind closed doors in 'The Cosa Nostra'; 'The Mafia'; 'The Family' or whatever these folks are known as. From the time Mario Puzo's pen first bled ink onto an empty pages, who would have guessed a masterpiece was about to be born. By the time Coppola's finishing touches on this creation, there could hardly be any doubt. This cinematographic brilliance known as, 'The Godfather' is a story hard to beat. There are those who say the movie is 'overrated'...to them...I say 'Go Watch ""The Birdman.""' Haters are just going to hate like a bunch of crybaby haters. ""The Godfather's"", writing and script are superb; the acting and cast is outstanding and the saga's story-line is unmatched, what else is needed? I like the pace and depth. No super villains and no super cops...just Mob vs. Mob vs. Mob...I love it. Anyways – watch this when you can - or if you haven't already. You are encouraged to come to your own conclusion using sound judgment. And remember...if you don't mark this as numba one you will want to reconsider – at least that's if you know what's good for you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),estebangonzalez10,10,18 September 2010,"¨I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.¨ Many people consider the 70's to be the Golden Age in Cinema, and if that is the case then Francis Ford Coppola had a great deal to do with it. During that decade he directed The Godfather Part 1 and 2, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now; he also produced American Graffiti, and wrote the screenplay for Patton. During that time he won 5 Oscars and was nominated for another seven. At least one of these films is on everybody's favorite movies list, and The Godfather is considered by many critics to be the best film of all time. Despite being nominated for eleven Oscars it only took home three (Best Picture, Best Performance by Marlon Brando, and Best Screenplay), just one more confirmation that a film can't be judged by the amount of awards it receives. The Godfather deserves much more. It is a movie that has transcended time and is enjoyed by everyone even decades after its first release. It was the first of its kind to portray the mafia from the inside and Coppola does a great job at romanticizing them and making us root for these criminals. How does he do it? By showing us the mafia as a strong and united family that supports each other; portraying the good guys as bad (there are corrupt cops and politicians); and making Vito Corleone stand out from the rest of the criminal families by not wanting to get involved in the drug business. He completely romanticizes the Corleone family and has us rooting for them from the very first scene thanks to a very intelligent script co-written with Mario Puzo who had previously written the bestselling novel. The script is amazing, the performances are great, and the direction from Coppola is just superb. All these elements combine perfectly to create this classic masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kelsey-munro,10,2 May 2005,"well i finally got round to watching Part 1 for the first time on Channel 5, I just wonder why i never got round to it earlier. This movie has set the standards for epic story's (why do people compare this to LOTR?). You can really see the drastic change that is happening to Vito and how the family business is changing. This film was also one of the few that can make me Very tense (especially when Vito was *SPOILER* at the restaurant talking to the bent Cop after going to the Bathroom) It just made me on the edge of my seat with anticipation on whether he would do it or how it would happen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BLDJ,10,28 February 2000,"Hmmmm... well... I spent some time thinking about what I would write about this movie. First off, I am very disappointed I can´t give this movie a 11. Because you see... it is that good. It is nothing more and nothing less than perfection- if they cut a part of the moive, I would miss it. If they add anything to it, I would discard it. Acting is top-notch. Direction cannot receive comments enough to describe how good it is. The story is one of the best ever. I mean... what more could anyone want?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joshi_3592,10,8 June 2010,"Why don't they make films like this anymore? This is what movies should be. Sure, they don't have to be this long, but 99% of todays movies are pretty weak compared to this. It's funny actually, I knew this was one of the most famous classics before I saw it. I knew it is considered among the top 10 films almost everywhere. Yet everyone I know has either referred to it as the most boring film in history or never even bothered to finish it. Now that I've seen it I can't help but think, what a pity. Today we are given so much garbage, that when a real film comes along, we are suddenly confused. We don't understand it, we miss the points, and we fail to see the subtext in it. It saddens me that that is what the film business has become, when we fail to see a masterpiece when it comes along. Francis Ford Coppola made a timeless film with the godfather, and he should rank among the top ten, no the top five directors of all time. Stanley Kubrick once said: ""Coppola sure got it right with The Godfather"". And I dare todays director to ""get it right"" in the future."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jahson70,9,31 December 2004,"The sequel of this movie is the American masterpiece, not this one"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Pteromysvolans,8,7 November 2003,"Godfather the best movie of all times, and the only movie worth a 9/10, and Godfather 2 the third best movie?? Come on..., the Godfather series has its moments and especially the first one is not a bad movie at all. But, IMHO, almost all the other major movies about Mafia (especially ""Goodfellas"" & ""Once Upon a Time in America"") are, more interesting and better art too than the bombastic Godfather series. I find even Brando's acting in these movies below his normal standards."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheNorthernMonkee,10,27 August 2003,"Ok, I'm two hours into this film and I just don't get the hype and appeal. I admit my choices in movie are varied (my top five films are ""American Beauty"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Casablanca"", ""Henry V"" and ""When Harry Met Sally""), but I watched this film with possibly too much expectation. A friend of mine adores this film, and any Mafia film in general, and along with the vast majority of imdb members, he recommended this film to me. The problem is, why?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jamezp1-1,1,22 October 2006,"This movie is like football, people only watch it because the think its 'cool' or 'popular', but really it is the most dreary repetitive and slow film i have had the displeasure in viewing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jonjonat,9,18 November 2009,I like to say that this movie was so fine that the violence and sexual references spoiled it all and the message was so deep. The Godfather is by far one of those movies that adults say even 16 year old kids like me can't watch it because it's very hard for even them to watch. It was rated R originally but they changed it to MA probably they think it's too offensive for viewers to say it's a masterpiece and doesn't deserve to be so highly rated. The Shawshank Redemption in the other hand was a perfect movie with the deepest message known as hope and was surprisingly rated MA in Australia and on the TV rating is Rated M which is more fair enough. The Godfather was just horrible and I really thought that Part 2 would be better but it really isn't and for once in my life I'm going to confirm that The Godfather shouldn't deserve to be known as a masterpiece
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rmax304823,8,5 April 2015,"It's a beautifully made movie. Not just because of the subtle direction by Francis Coppola but because of the production design (Dean Tavoularis) and photography (Gordon Willis). Everything seems to lend itself to the impact of the story, which describes the replacement of Marlon Brando's Mafia chief by his youngest son, Al Pacino. Make up is expertly handled. Pacino's broken cheek is properly swollen and blue and fades gradually, providing the viewer with a kind of cinematic clock telling the passage of time. Nino Rota's score is tops. During the baptism scene, which takes place in a church, the organ hums an apt courtly tune. Then, as the film cross cuts between ritualized religion and ritualized homicide, the organ insensibly becomes darker and more ominous."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adebayor-1,8,20 July 2007,"I personally believe that Godfater is one the most boring but ""Famous"" movies of all time.The moment anybody hears the word GODFATHER they """"want"""" to believe that this is the best movie of all but in the real sense it is far from being great.People tell that AL Pacino got known by this movie but all he ever did was keep his mouth shut except for a few scenes unlike his other movies like Scarface,Heat,Devil's Advocate,Dog Day Afternoon etc.Even the """"great Marlon Brando"""" did not have much role in it.The entire movie is filled with conversation and nothing else.If there was A man in this entire planet who never saw or even heard anything about any movie,and you show him ""The Godfather"",I bet that he would probably go to sleep within the first 10 minutes.We the people of todays generation are made to believe that this is the best movie of all time by the media and other people.Honestly the only reason i saw this movie was to find out what the hell was there in it that is receiving so much appreciation.Guys who have not seen this movie might also be thinking the same that this movie is the best bit in reality,it is not.This movie is a very long piece of ****"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oacmgm,8,9 July 2006,"I personally believe that this movie is overrated. I don't really even believe it is the best work from a Coppola (I personally believe ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Lost in Translation"" are much better movies), but it still is entertaining to watch. It has notable performances by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino (perhaps the only Pacino performance other than ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" where he doesn't scream his eyes out), and the film also has a very nice screenplay, but the movie isn't as entertaining or extraordinary as other frontrunners like ""Casablanca"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Maybe because this movie has been marred by so many rip-offs or clones, that the magic of the film has disappeared. The film just no longer feels ageless, and that's too bad."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Evilaster,10,16 May 2020,I really adore this type of movies and i watched a lot of them but the godfather movie is an exception its soo much different how they build the characters the environment the story and the most amazing thing was the dialogue its just so great i cant even expect any movie in this period to compete with this piece of art
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kesavanmaharajan,10,17 October 2017,"One pretty legit movie.I watched this movie so late. I found out something that this film is a base for lot of movies. Marlon Brando's acting is outstanding, his accent man!! got me like this 😐 he killed it. while he saying ""you don't call me godfather"" aha!! god i'm down. Al Pacino he too smashed his acting, still got to watch part 2 and get surprised."

The story, although fictional, describes effective where the greed leads for power and money. Generations kill themselves to get in a short life to power, money and influence. When viewers the baser instincts are addressed. You may find yourself doing that you feel satisfaction when a bad guy kills an even nastier. You can dismiss this as ""Movie"", but in reality everything is worse. What finally remains at the end of life, how early it always ends left? This shows not this movie. Namely a body in a box."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shahabshahrjerdi,6,5 September 2019,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EJR21,1,9 February 2003,"This is a very good movie that is very overrated.  I  agree that it belongs on the top 250 list, bust its rank as the best movie of all time is slightly overblown.

Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, all fine, fine actors, did not like the movie. Why? I couldn't get into it. It insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in, you spend like six and a half hours, I can't even get through it. I can't even finish the movie. I've never even seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs. I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different language. That's where I lose interest and I go away. I love The Money Pit with the guy from Big. Funny guy, Tom Hanks, everything he says is a stitch!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fostrhod,8,19 December 2020,"Being a bit of a novice when it comes to gangster movies I watched the Godfather for the first time in over 35 years, I recall the lovely scene with the use of ""speak softly love"" when Michael is in hiding in Sicily, but apart from that very little. What a wonderful film, love the sense of family and loyalty that is present throughout. Al Pacino is breathtaking and carries an underlying sense of menace, it is his film. Brando may get the top billing but his role his merely a cameo to Pacino. The clinical dispatch of the families is a wonder to see and a lovely climax to the movie.
Apart from the careless continuity flaws. Michael Corleone's ever changing bruised cheek being the main one. This film is a masterpiece."

Marlon Brando's strength is in acting well. Al Pacino is great as a young man and even better as an old man. ""The Godfather"" received three Oscars - for best picture, for best actor (Marlon Brando) and for best adapted screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola). It was also nominated in seven other categories, including Best Supporting Actor (Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall) and Best Director (Francis Ford Coppola).

We sat down one evening to watch it and she was immediately hooked. We then spent the next 2 evenings watching 2 & 3... 3 a little disappointing mainly for Sophia's pathetic acting skills. The finale when she finally cops it was worth the wait though. How on earth Al Pacino did not win an Oscar for his performance is astonishing. Do try to watch them on DVD great film, deserves great quality... Can't wait to see it on the big screen one day...Here's hoping."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mal karma,10,15 August 2002,"It's remarkable how a film 30 years old can still amaze even teens (I'm 17, you know). It has an incredible script and its filming is just perfect. It doesn't have any flaw, and probably the best highlight is its cast with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. etc. etc., all of them shine thru the movie and make this (too) long film most enjoyable despite the extreme length. With two worth viewing sequels (specially Godfather II with the majestic Robert De Niro), The Godfather is best saga in history of movies, much, but much more than Star Wars. The one and only classic in movie history, the best of all times that can never be beaten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anhomes,10,25 May 2021,"Every time George Hamilton appears onscreen, we can't help but miss the great Robert Duvall, and though Coppola has slightly trimmed his daughter Sofia's screen time, it's still an unfortunately amateurish performance, especially when contrasted with the go-big-or-go-home method of Andy Garcia as her volatile cousin and love interest. But Pacino and Diane Keaton as Kay, his ex-wife (and the love of his life) and the mother of his children, are magnificent together in some of the movie's quietest and most effective moments. And there's something great and offbeat about Joe Mantegna's performance as the violent mob boss Joey Zasa; Mantegna performs his lines as if he's onstage doing a play by his longtime collaborator David Mamet, e.g., when Mantegna as Zasa says in staccato fashion, ""Yes, it's true, if anyone could say such a thing, he would not be a friend, he would be a dog."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rocknrollmaniac2,1,14 January 2007,this movie was horrible i don't understand how this is a good movie. Al Pacino's worst movie. Marlon Brando was horrible. So many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned. Francis ford Coppola is a bad director. Goerge Lucas is the best director ever. I'd give this movie a 3.0 on a 10 scale. The best movie in the world is easily material girls. Hilary duff is so hot in that movie. The screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad. A movie you should see is Material girls the best movie ever. Good directing screenplay and defiantly acting. Another good movie was From Justin to Kelly. Justin is hot in his swimsuit but Kelly needs to lose pounds.

Inspiring performances from Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando and of course, Al Pacino. This movie is so real, so riveting that you feel for these mobsters, these supposed monsters of our civilization. In the scene where Pacino shoots the drug lord and the cop, you are screaming to yourself as Michael is waiting to do the deed, ""shoot them, please, shoot them!""

It won three Academy Awards (for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay Adaptation).

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SleeveApplicatorManufacturer,9,4 September 2022,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnmarktyuiop,10,24 December 2023,"""The Godfather"" stands as an unparalleled cinematic achievement that transcends mere storytelling to become a cultural phenomenon and a benchmark for excellence in filmmaking. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this 1972 classic has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films in history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moa242,7,31 January 2015,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted,"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dreamknot,3,18 July 2006,"well, i worked in a video store for five years and for five years everyone nagged me to see 'the godfather' and for whatever reason it simply never interested me. i love films but wouldn't consider myself a pedant who nitpicks about minor details. a film doesn't have to be entirely perfect for me to enjoy it or feel that it was worthwhile to watch. i like to get lost in a film when i watch it. be it a quick comedy or an epic saga. there are films that have plenty of continuity errors and even bits of really bad acting, and i've watched them several times, because it's a satisfying experience. well, i finally watched the godfather tonight. i finally felt ready to watch it without bias and without towing all the talk and hype behind it into the experience (well, i did the best i could to start with a clean slate, but couldn't always succeed. for example, i'm sure the horse head in the bed at the beginning would have been more shocking and effective if i hadn't heard that scene referenced thousands of times). overall, i have to say that i really wasn't very impressed, and, even before i remembered that it was, in fact, based on a book, i was left with that empty sensation of too much missing information and imbalance of characters that sadly happens with too many adaptations. also -- and as i said, i don't deliberately go seeking out errors, especially during a first viewing, but... -- the editing in so many parts was really bad enough to take away from the movie experience. it was difficult to pay attention to the dialogue because the cut-to's during some of the conversations were so blatantly recorded at different times that i forgot about my own involvement in the film and instead had to sit through these confusing cuts. likewise with the 40's atmosphere. i'll bring 'the hype' into the argument for a moment here to comment only in retrospection, but for all the talk of how classic and what a masterpiece this film is, i would have thought it to be more... i don't know... scrutinised? and there were just too many times when i would find myself involved in a scene, drawn in, convinced, fully attentive, and then there would be a completely random cut, even dialogue cut in mid-sentence when fading to the next scene. so strange. parts gave me the impression of watching a well-financed, well-meaning rough draft. all that said, some of the acting, not all, but some, was in fact, first rate. Marlon Brando really didn't convince me. he was good. but nothing special, i'm almost sorry to say. the wife (i forget her name) who was married at the beginning, she always seemed really out of place and ... i can't quite put my finger on it, but her fits just didn't flow with the film. i thought James Caan did a great job. i've only ever seen him in 'thief' and 'bottle rocket,' so i can't really make any worthy comparisons with other performances. but his hot-headedness was convincing enough. Robert Duvall was great. i didn't recognise him for almost the first half of the film. another acting gem for me was Al Pacino. he, too, i didn't recognise at the beginning of the film. for a few moments i mistook him for Adrian Brody, even though i knew that was impossible. but i was immediately drawn in by ""Michael's"" performance. every gesture and every word was electric. it took me about twenty minutes to realise that i was watching Al Pacino. then, furthermore, i was really impressed by the evolution of his character. that's one thing i think they really nailed solid with this film, from Pacino's acting to the storyline and editing and everything all rolled into one. i came away entirely convinced and ruminating on the life and thoughts of this character. i watched and admired the power he carried in his manner even when he was, in the beginning, insofar as the bloody family business was concerned, innocent. then saw that power unfold and transform itself until, in the end, he was finally consumed by the corruption inherent in the prioritisation of his blood-family's honour. however, apart from this character and a few other performances, there really wasn't enough ""meat"" to this movie to make me want to see it again. i'm curious about the sequel(s), to see where the story goes. but by the end of this first viewing i was mostly just wondering who was going to die next, and i didn't really care. i was plenty intrigued by Michael, but i felt like i was mostly sticking around to see who would be left standing by the time the credits rolled. maybe the whole mafia style depiction thing just isn't enough for me to be able to sympathise or feel anything when the next trench coat gets strangled or shot or stabbed. so, overall, there were indeed a very few classic moments, and some of the acting was really well performed. but on the whole it just didn't chalk up to much for me, least of all a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),madaraszmilan,9,31 March 2019,"I know this film is classic gangster film becasuse good scene and characters, story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gaidykov,10,19 January 2022,"For me, this film is the standard of what a film should be in general. I never use superlative words, but here is the perfect direction, the perfect script, the perfect acting, the perfect music. Until now (and it's been 36 years), in my opinion, nothing has been shot in the genre of ""gangster thriller"", not only superior, but even close in quality. It's not a movie -it's life. You can watch it endlessly, and with each viewing discover some new details, circumstances, thoughts. At one time I watched it endlessly, in Russian and in English, and read the book, and in general I was a real fan, which almost never happens to me. Now I prefer films that are less bloody, but I take my hat off to the creator."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Irshad_qureshi,9,16 October 2017,the film is very good the script is good every moment in the film is interesting and all series the god father is cool and learning some thing. this film made is 1972 that why i m very impressed and congrats the all team the god father film very intelligently play and really script is good my salute to writer who believe in the film every second .so i m so glad to watch this movie and watching again and learning some different.

Love it really love"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jansen-aui,10,23 June 2006,"It's amazing to think, having listened to Francis Ford Coppola's DVD commentary, that his 1972 epic The Godfather was produced under such incredible studio and financial pressure  one can only imagine what this picture could have been if Coppola was given a little more control. To this day, The Godfather remains a classic, truly extraordinary, and etched into the memories of all who've seen it. It is one of the most widely acclaimed and financially successful films of all time, consistently among the top film lists of most, and is my personal favourite motion picture."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),steatc,10,13 May 2004,"Well where can I start it was just fantastic from start to finish. The mix of innocent Michael getting mixed up. I was just gripped by this. All the actors in this movie are top notch and especially with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in it. Also the likes of Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton who have made a real name for themselves a real name from this movie. I could not get enough of Michael Corleone, that icy character that hardly lost his temper, and never would let you know what he was thinking, really gripped into watching this movie over and over again.my hat comes off to Francis and his team they have made a true masterpiece that is THE GODFATHER. I really do reccomend this movie to anybody who knows good film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tognaboloney,7,9 September 2018,"This movie is great, although it is not perfect. Growing up i would always hear that 
 this is the greatest movie of all time, and when i finally sat down to watch it I had a blast. Its filled with many great performances, great cinematography, and etc. The reason I am giving it a 7 is because i feel it has a pacing issue, theres a lot of unneeded shots and not every performance was believable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vengpah,2,27 November 2006,"I recently saw the godfather again, 34 times I think. Now, never was a Brando fan, can't stand mob movies, so why should I like this one? Simply, because everyone else does. Its not that the acting's bad (except for brando) its not that its a mob movie, OK, it is that it is a mob movie. I mean seriously, pick a better topic! Not a realistic view of the mob. The mob did things quietly never have I heard in history of a mobsters getting gunned down in his car by many bullets. Oh, and another thing, if this movie is supposed to be realistic, why did the gas can blow up when the shot the car?"

They are both executed with razor-like care and crafted atop a foundation of brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a brilliant script by a brilliant writer, brilliant photography, brilliant production design, and a brilliant score. And it was the first film to give mainstream insight to the world of Ogranised Crime - an insight so true that Mario Puzo was questioned by the Mafia about his sources."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ursuladuke,9,30 January 2023,"It took me years to sit down and watch it, because I assumed it was a film made for men only, i.e. Another recital of machismo. I was surprised to find myself engaged with the movie from the very beginning. The magnificent acting, the incredible character development and the variety of different personalities, in combination with the outstanding storytelling, direction, cinematography, atmosphere, music, drew me into this brutal tale about toxic masculinity and life degradation. It's a movie that provoked contradictory feelings to me. The more I watched, the more appalled I felt by what people can turn into once they gain power and at the same time, the more interested I got into the fates of those horrible people. It's quite an irresistible trap masterfully set by super talented actors and creators, that produced iconic moments that linger. To me, there is a certain allure about old cinema, in contradiction to nowadays' fast-food film making. I was quite bothered though, by the little room this long movie left for women's presence. I understand the need to realistically portray the patriarchal life in mafia, where women are treated like props, like merely male successors-generators, but I felt there was a lack in balance, as we only get to see a glimpse of what this life was like for the women involved. Nevertheless, it is a great movie I would actually re-watch."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nikstallone,7,4 May 2016,"The Godfather, the first film in the franchise, was released on March 15, 1972. The feature-length film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based upon Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. The plot begins with Don Vito Corleone declining an offer to join in the narcotics business with notorious drug lord Virgil Sollozzo, which leads to an assassination attempt. Meanwhile, Vito's oldest son Sonny takes over the family and Michael strikes back for the assassination attempt by killing Sollozzo and a corrupted police captain, forcing Michael to go to Sicily in hiding. While in Sicily, Michael travels around the country and meets a young woman whom he marries, but who is eventually killed in a car bombing. Michael returns to America after the news of his brother Sonny's murder. After returning, Vito turns over the reins of the family to Michael. Michael plans to move the family business to Las Vegas; but before the move, he plots the killing of the heads of the five families on the day of his nephew's baptism. Other subplots include Vito's daughter's abusive marriage, Johnny Fontaine's success in Hollywood, and Vito's second oldest son Fredo's role in the family business in Las Vegas."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yeahmorelife,10,21 December 2019,"The film is about important values like a honor and a family. The Family is the holiest for members of the Corleone's family. They are always on the side of their relatives and it doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong. Everyone, who promises a friendship and a loyalty, can count on a protection of the Family. Everyone, who betrays the Family, will be killed. It brings to mind the words of Michael Corleone. ""Don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever."" All of them bound by blood in their veins and blood of murders. Also there is the incredible music by Nino Rota. The tune is known worldwide! Great Marlon Brando and young Al Pacino! I never get tired of watching their acting. My favorite scene is at the end of the film when Michael becomes the Godfather. The combination of contrasts: the birth and the death, the baby and corpses, day and night. Great movie! I strongly recommend everyone."

So let's start with acting I guess and oh boy it is amazing. All the characters feel so real, dialogues are really deep and full of meaning. Plot also is very strong and interesting, you can watch this movie like over and over and not get tired of shown scenes, character dialogues. Movie always keeps you interested in what is going to happen, you don't want to miss a single detail because movie makes it just that much interesting. And last the music. Music choice in the movie is so good and fits scenes so well, I just can't express it, you just have to watch it, it stick in your head and fills it with something I can't express. Definitely give it a try."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),taoufikmassaoudi,10,6 July 2023,Introduction:
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),richardcoppage,10,14 November 2005,"No! But it is in the top five. The Godfather is the king of mobster and mafia films. It goes where no family has ever gone before. Marlone Brando is The Godfather, the head master of the family. His raspy voice is copied by people all over the world, but is never mastered. The Godfather is such a great film. But, I do warn you though. It's a long,long film. I think it's about 3 hours long. If you don't like sitting there for 3 hours watching a movie, then watch it hour by hour. It's a hard decision to make..if The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Some people say yes, others no. I say..and I stand by this..The Wizard of Oz is the greatest film of all time. Yeah, yeah, I'm picking Oz over The Godfather. The Godfather is #3 on my list, which is a pretty hard list to get on. You must watch this film. It's one of America's classics. This comments has taught me many this. It taught me..keep your friends close..and your enemies closer. That's in part 2..but, Hey! Who's keeping up?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BradoTabrez,10,16 August 2021,You thinking why I am said The Godfather is amazing when You Show then you know why I am said the godfather is amazing.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),katanaguy,10,25 October 2017,"Perhaps the single greatest movie I have ever seen. I was a student back then at Arizona State and I had heard about it from others shortly after it was released. At first after seeing it for the 1st time I thought the Don was wicked....then after seeing it several times he was actually protecting his loved ones even though he was in criminal activities yet many of his moves were handing out needed justice that the courts did not provide his fellow Italians with in NY. I saw the strong family values in him yet it was hard for me to realize his was a dark career. He created his own empire from zero having got off the boat all by himself as a very young boy after watching his family murdered in Italy, but what he saw from that was what raw power could do for a person from what that Italian Don had done to his own family. I think it internally made him gain same type of absolute power yet try to use it with fairness in family and related situations. He was not a wild cut throat Don.....there was honor in his power and we all could see it. Wonderful movie of an immigrant coming to America all alone and with perseverance and actual self preservation rise to power his people and lead them through then American tough times for most. He not only won the battle....he won the war as he saw it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aparicio777,7,25 October 2020,"Don't get me wrong, it was good, a pretty damn good film. But I read the book before I saw this film so I felt like the audience got skimped out on a lot of great and important details. And I'm sorry to say but Brando did not give The Don the justice he deserved. In the book The Don is beyond words. And Brando was simply excellent."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ellagilbert-23101,4,10 February 2021,Before i fell asleep i was extremely bored. couldn't tell you what the plot is whatsoever.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmet-kirbali,10,23 March 2022,This was the best movie I've ever seen. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the production and the game for giving me this beautiful feeling.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AzgotheDefiler,10,19 July 2020,For years I ignored this movie thinking it might be too overrated and couldn't sit through such a long film . The movie is bit slow paced but has some fast paced sequences . Michael Corloene and Tom are my favorite characters . The climax was just amazing . Every actor did an amazing job . Must watch
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),okhamrakulov,9,13 June 2020,For those who have not seen this movie. Just for you ...
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),toushifhaq,10,2 June 2022,Thi movie has been in my wishlist for forever. Finally watched it and i wasnt dissapointed. Can't believe they made this masterpiece in 1970s! Loved the character development of Michael and how he takes over his father's role - but more dagerous and shrewd.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hahmadnadeem,10,4 June 2020,No words can define this movie it's100/10 and i still think this rating is way less and who am I to rate this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vinniejo,10,27 January 2008,"I must've seen this movie more than a hundred times over the past seven years or so, but I still can't get enough of it. It was released in 1972 and there is hardly any doubt in my mind that it has truly stood the test of time. It is a brilliant adaptation of the bestseller novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),florianlahl-71014,10,17 May 2022,"To be Quote honest this movie isn't a perfect 10/10. It's a nearly perfect movie and truly a benchmark for cinema. Everything you could take into consideration when rating a movie is top notch in this film. But there are two complaints I have: The character of Sonny was a bit to flashy and the duration of the movie is quite the number. Now, of course everything in the movie was necessary for the plot and the character development of for example Michael but you cannot deny that especially movie newcomers can find the movie boring at points because it is so dense in its plot with only a few sprinkles of action. That didn't bother me, I think the movie has a great rolling time and it's one of the best if not the best movie ever made but nonetheless it's something of challenge to watch for people that aren't as interested in movies as other people are."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kickacan,7,4 March 2013,"I recently watched the Godfather again on DVD after many years - actually watched it twice. Obviously, this film is an icon in American pop-culture and there probably is nothing new to be said about it. But I will try to make a few fresh observations here. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mukhtarfaqiri,3,10 May 2017,"Maybe it is simply because I am not from the generation of when this movie came out back in '72, but my god this was a bore."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gumber-nitin,9,18 August 2013,Never get bored of watching this movie again and again. It truly is an epic and a classical worth a billion likes and a rating of 9. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Andy_Ashton,10,11 July 2020,"Godfather is truly an iconic movie and one of Marlon Brando's most epic performances as an Actor. This movie represents, what it's like to be truly involved in the Italian Mafia, traditional family values, loyalty and most importantly to honor your word.
Regardless of the years that go by, the Godfather will always remain as one of those movies, that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),farshadv,10,26 April 2020,"There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rizwansadruddinjindani,9,23 April 2022,It was good enough to represent every character with a different style and best script I love all the characters. And all love the casting done by them.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lunatickiller,10,23 January 2004,This film is Francis Ford Copollas best work together with The Godfather Part II.It shows how mobsters ran and still run their families and that its origin truly is Sicilian.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yayamafiya-55211,9,17 June 2019,"This movie is very good, I like it very much. I watch it when I was small and didnt understand, I think is like soap opera. But I watch it again, recently, and now I understand and like it very much."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nobody-27784,10,24 April 2018,"Reducing a fat, thick, best-selling novel to manageable screenplay terms has always been a major problem for any filmmaker blessed (or cursed) with the assignment. What do you include? What do you leave out? Perhaps even more important, how do you cast to anticipate the expectations of the millions who have already read the book? "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ssullivan-47138,6,4 April 2020,This movie is a classic. It introduced a lot of up and coming stars. Definitely a movie that needs to be added to your catalog. The horse head in the bead is iconic
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DreamScapeSev7n,3,21 January 2019,I don't typically like gangster mob films. I tried this film because I thought it would be a good film to see as a student studying film. I didn't like it and I guess I should have known I wouldn't. Cheers to those who do.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),darkwarss,10,30 June 2021,Wow! One of the best crafted movies I've ever seen! The atmosphere is just taking you back in those crazy times.. Just speechless how much I liked this film.

This movie was worth watching and i am watching it so late but i don't care. Anyway, the movie was great, i loved it..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),underspell,10,29 June 2020,"Everything you want a film to be, this is it. Amazing character(s) development and story that keeps you interested. All the actors seemed to be born to play these characters, especially Brando and Pacino who are at their finest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eagandersongil,10,27 August 2016,"What can I say about one of the most remarkable films of cinema history ?, certainly any list you seek, is the Rolling Stone or syndicated actors, ""Godfather"" will be in the top 3 at least, not is less, see and witness the best that cinema has to present an extremely slow movie, 3 hours, but at the same time it is fast and keep it captivates and holds the viewer deeply during the I80 minutes I80 this that are pure tension, drama, suspense and intrigue, with impeccable script by Francis Ford Coppola which is based on the book by Mario Puzo (which also has a stake in the script), Godfather is one of those cases where the film is better than the book, as I had before, his script is impeccable, his rhymes triumphant narratives, their rhythm is perfect, the constitutions of their actions are a class of cinema, Marlon Brando makes a spectacular interpretation as little before seen in the movies, playing Don Vito Corleone he steals the movie scene in the first act, showing all his logic on ethics of the mafia, while its violence and brutality, in the second and third act who steals the film is the amazing Al Pacino doing an interpretation as ingenious when Brando in the role of Michel, Al Pacino gives an acting show, remained well contained, and completely changing your look from the beginning of the film, you really believe in Michael, the film photography is amazing and helps perpetuate the half dozen scenes that went to the story that this film contains, it is worth mentioning the scenes in Italy and baptized, as well the first 30 minutes of the film, the soundtrack is one of those that you listen and already feel the tone of the film, you play with music, and its perfection, worth highlighting Nino Rota for the soundtrack. Well, Godfather is a film that talks about mafia, drugs, death, violence, illegality, corruption, addiction, etc .. yet he is beautiful, beautiful, it seems ennoble impure acts at the same time cause the same disclaimers, but end you delights and surprises, because it also talks about family, loyalty, friendship and acceptance, watch this movie, even if it is your movie genre, at least try, there's no way you leave the loss with this work as striking the 7 art."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gelboy-1,9,24 January 2004,"The Godfather is simply a truly great film, that has some of the best acting ever committed to film. Pacino is superb, Brando inspiring and Caan one of cinemas great angry men. It is a film of operatic brilliance and I is the best gangster film ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fforfaisal-24-668625,10,26 August 2013,"I just love this Movie. I always see something new every time I've seen it ""Countless, Truly & Magical""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cenkspectrum,10,1 February 2005,"The best movie ever made... I think Francis Ford Coppolla's Godfather is best in all ways of directing,acting,musical,cinematographic... Although it tells a story of everything; i mean so many characters you see in movie and different emotions from all type you feel doesn't make you away from story.You become part of this life told in movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bootlebarth,7,23 November 2014,I admire the way authors and directors have fun with their readers and viewers by including scenes of great dramatic impact that are completely unexplained.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),raminrahbar,10,29 December 2020,"The best film forever!!!!!
The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of one of his sons, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),theharshitpoddar,10,3 March 2019,"Breaking the norm by making the audience sympathize with the Mafias, this film is well crafted and holds up the intended emotions in every scene. The dark lives of the mafias do not matter to the audience as they are busy rooting for it's humane characters. Coppola successfully humanizes the characters and maintains the tragic nature of the film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rjparrish-862-350640,10,8 December 2013,"Godfather is not just ...A... classic gangster film it is...THE... classic gangster film. Marlon Brando is an amazing actor when he's not a big fat lazy jerk reading his lines off of a piece of paper hanging on the wall (and yes he actually did crap like that from what I heard in class) and this is one of his best performances if not the best performance he ever did. Robert Duvall and James Caan are always the same in their performances but they are good in this, probably because they are so young and their shtick wasn't old yet. Pacino is really very good. His weak brother is also very good in his role. The ladies in Pacino's life are very good. I really loved this movie, the drama is great and also there are some really great violent gangster action scenes. The scene where Sonny is racing to town in his old car and gets stopped at the toll booth is an all time classic, don't want to give away details but it sticks with you. Awesome movie!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DaraOakwood,9,6 April 2018,The Godfather product of 1972 is one of the leading movies in drama & crime in the history of cinema. which effects the movies until this time by it's own well performed space.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),miseenplaceind,10,14 March 2024,"It's one of those movies that just sticks with you long after the credits roll. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, it's a real masterpiece."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jermainechurchbrand,10,15 November 2023,"This movie is just one of the ""You have to love"" films. Never gets old or outdated. Like ever! Majority of all the reviews that were already left, about this movie, has already been said. If I were to piggyback off anyone. It would this. Get you some popcorn, sit down and relax. Matter of fact, I'm about to watch it as I type. The acting in this film, fits the narrative of gangsters and mob bosses. Infact, you would think, that these actors were just living their normal lives, with a camera following around them. Now those are some facts, about a great film. You couldn't find any set of actors in today's world, to play this movie any better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nickielena,6,26 June 2020,It was very interesting. I love this genre of movies.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),primusfreak,5,29 August 2006,"Once Upon A Time In America is a far superior movie. Francis Ford Coppola shoots his movies like asshole, but then again so do his pals Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. If Sergio Leone had directed this like he was originally asked to, it would have been great, but he didn't, he passed it by. Martin Scorcese also would have made a harder kick ass version and I don't mean more violent, I mean Just-Plain-Better. Instead you have the weak cinema of an overrated narcissist. Of course it's a decent film, but it's far from a timeless classic like the afore mentioned OUATIA. It's as dated a Dirty Harry, but you don't see that in the top ten films of all time. The greatest technical achievement made by the film makers was in the field of Special Make-up Effects, by Dick Smith. That is all."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MehmetBulun,10,4 April 2022,"It's a successful movie, I recommend it to everyone, it's really successful. All the actors of the movie are great, the scenes are very good, thank you for not avoiding any expense and presenting such a beautiful movie to us."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aliamur-53409,9,4 February 2018,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),K3nzit,10,28 December 2019,"This Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is perfect in so many levels that it's hard to put it into words. It is such a great character study and the performances by Brando, Pacino and Duvall help make it the classic that it is."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),larrymallory-615-304184,6,10 April 2023,I loved this Film Back in the Mid 80's Growing Up Al Pacino who Is My Favorite Actor growing up was brilliant along with the late Marlon Brando. This Film Changed the culture of Gang Movies Everywhere Like Boyz In The Hood And Menace II Society. Watching Francis Ford And the late James Cann Was the Best Scene. The Sopranos Director David Chase was Inspired By This Film will always Become A Cultural Phenomenon Because of its LIfe in the Mob world and for Me Growing Up. This is one of greatest Films of All Time I know they Had Part 2 And part 3 But For Me the 1st one will always be the Best one.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jmarktip,3,10 August 2015,"Even though I gave this film a three star rating (pretty high for me), I consider it one of the more overrated ever. Reviewers from some newspapers and magazines gave it strong advanced notices, and that got the ball rolling before other media and the public saw it. Plus it had almost an all-star cast headed by Brando, often considered the king of American actors of his generation. Granted Pacino and some of the others were young but most of the cast had some reputation going in."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),travtask1,9,24 September 2022,"Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),s_iliya_p,9,24 October 2012,"It was a great movie. Don Corleone is a bad guy. every one is a bad guy here,they all do bad things,they all do crimes. But you can't escape from the fact that you love Don Corleone(Marlon Brando). The scene that he cries after his son(Sonny)died,made me cry. And I think that's what a movie is all about,You love the bad guys,because They're Good! I guess the Director some how skips the ""back together part"" when Micheal and Kay get back together!Or Apolonia(Mike's first wife in the movie)'s death. I guess it was for shortening the movie,or maybe it just Doesn't matter. But Francis Ford Coppola could shorten another scenes. It was a great movie after all,maybe the greatest, I voted 9."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sautron,10,8 April 2021,"I usually don't like movies before 1995 for several reasons, maybe because I'm younger and I'm used to the movies of the 2000's. All I can say is that it's the only ""old"" movie that impressed me. And I realized why it is seen as one of the best movies. It's one of those movies that you have to see in your lifetime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aidan-cc,10,5 February 2011,"The Godfather is possibly one of the best constructed films I have ever seen: the lighting and colouring are perfect, giving every frame an almost painting like quality; the camera work is brilliantly modest; and the film hosts some of the greatest acting ever committed to celluloid."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lord_konan,10,25 October 2006,"PROS: Just flat out great, it is a instant classic you cannot get any better when it comes to Mafia movies. The movie had an overly perfect cast. The story never strayed. The tragities were well played out. The chemistry between the cast was well seen. It was a excellent good versus evil film that you can watch over and over and over and over and again and again and again till you are blue in the face and barf all over your television set (if this happens contact you doctor imediately). It was the only film that is easily compared to Star Wars and can simply be considerd as a great and spectacular saga."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PatrickDuctant,9,6 March 2024,"The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hmaan-92196,10,19 September 2021,"Great work.an inspiration to generations of actors,directors,screenwriters and producers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lavaside-60237,10,8 August 2020,"This movie is a masterpiece. They should have left it alone. Everyone talks bad about the 3rd; but the 2nd was to the 1st, what the 3rd was to the 2nd."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ILoveLOTR,10,5 April 2002,"This movie has it all, great acting by Marlon Brando and James Caan, great characters, the same two, and great action and story. The aspect that carries this movie is the great acting by Marlon Brando that totally gets you into the Don Corleone character and introduces you to the world of the mafia and all of their families."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aciessi,10,26 January 2021,"I've been in the rare position as a cinephile to have never watched The Godfather. I've been in the even rarer position of being an Italian-American cinephile that has never watched The Godfather. That has now thankfully changed. I can cross off my bucket list, at least, the first installment of this treasured film franchise. To millions, it's the greatest film of all time. To filmmakers and film lovers, the experience alone is a pilgrimage. To Italians in America, it's a vital piece of our history, for better or worse. It's an epic tragedy about absolute power, vengeance, violence as a means to an end and the traditions of a family through generations. Vito Corleone passes it all down to his son, Michael and with it, the price of his soul. But to Michael, there is no price. His soulless brown eyes say it all. He's fully consumed by power by the film's end. It's corrupting influence be dammed. I could go on, but frankly, I don't need to. The Godfather speaks for itself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),HelenMary,7,28 November 2015,"The Godfather, is most people's favourite film, and arguably one of the best films ever made. However, I only saw it in 2015 for the first time, so my impression of it is different to those who have grown up with it. I thought the film was brilliant, some really powerful performances and many huge stars now in their youth; Diane Keaton, Al Pacino and James Caan. The film has not aged well, but is still gripping and interesting, and in place visceral and emotional. James Caan as the protective older brother was memorable but of course Marlon Brando stands out as the much parodied, copied and admired main character to whom everyone defers. As I said, the film has dated and his prosthesis padded mouth doesn't look so good as I imagine it did when first released, and the make-up on Pacino was also distractingly bad. The film jumps forward in time quickly, and doesn't explain anything, as films are wont to do more latterly, which is refreshing, and the plot is complex enough to require full attention, and whilst it's not a laugh a minute ""enjoyable"" film, or about subject matter which is pleasant, is bloody and violent, it is worth watching and certainly one of cinema's most brilliant masterpieces. I think my impression of this film is lessened by the fact that I didn't see it for until now so didn't have the loyalty to ""The Family"" that longtime watchers have, when they've grown up with it, but it was amazing to finally see the original from which many other films have taken their cue or inspiration."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lilxacah,1,17 July 2019,", the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anthonydejames,10,19 October 2019,I have seen this film too many times and I always go back and back and back cuz I love it. loved this
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sudhiimagine,9,8 February 2022,"I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."

I have seen all the Mob, gangster or movies having to do with these types of setting like Goodfellas, Scarface, Billy Bath Gate to name a few and nothing comes close. a true Homerun and for sure a MUST SEE!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sexymimiyang,10,8 April 2022,"Nice. Its a. This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),doncorleone,10,28 April 2000,"The Godfather Trilogy spreads motivation, like no one movie until today. I don't want to say that it is the best movie ever (because you shouldn't compare movies just like that), but I haven't seen anything like this. It is more than a movie, it is a lifestyle."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alex-17318,10,16 July 2021,This movie is not one of my favorite crime movies but it is still very good I never read the book but the movie is just amazing such as The Godfather 2.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marianajb,10,24 November 2016,"""The Godfather"" along with ""The Gofather: Part II"" are the best movies I have ever seen. Absolutely everything of it is magnificent, pure magic, gold, etc. The performances, the directing, the screenplay, the production, the script, the soundtrack, the film editing, the costume design, and the list goes on and on. The performances are excellent, all of them, through that you can see all the work the director Francis Ford Coppola made, which is one i truly admire. This movie is irreplaceable, a true piece of art. A classic. It involves love, crime, passion, negotiations, family, loyalty, respect. For me is just the perfect combo, because I love movies with violence, I also love movies with romance. I think there will never be a movie as perfect as this one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ad59235,7,22 April 2016,"Well... if I had to choose the ultimate Gangsta movie to review this tops the list! Action..Crime..Suspense to name a few are all included in this flick, and it does not disappoint. This is your go-to movie when you want to feel like the ultimate CRIME BOSS (minus the jail time)Definitely one of Francis Ford Coppola best films. He really captures the essence of the lifestyle these Good fellas have. In retrospect he breathes life into the characters that already hold enough personality for an entire football team. If I had to rate it between one and ten I would say a seven, only because the movie is so damn dark you feel like the director shot the entire flick at night!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stellmacjt08,2,2 October 2003,"Three words to describe this film... BAD BAD BAD...  Not worth five minutes of your time...  Goodfellas and Casino are lightyears better. Ok, maybe that is a little harsh, but seriously, this is not one of the top 250 movies of all time... it does have some merit, so maybe overall it deserves a 5.0/10 ... but, given that this movie is lacking in so many other areas, I have no choice but to award it a 1.0/10.0"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),poponewsflash,10,22 April 2003,"I didnt see The Godfather trilogy until very recently. I heard about it's greatness from everywhere, so I decided to take  look at them. By far, I thought that The Godfather was a great movie, because not only is it a great Mafia/Cosa Nostra movie, it subtly throws in messages of the importance of family and respect. That is why I think this movie is a ten. The Godfather will stand the test of time, and it will be a movie I want my kids to see (when theyre a little older of course)."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mdwasifbinhafiz,9,4 August 2021,The film is amazing and one of the favorite movie of all time.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johndoeggitano-57447,10,4 June 2022,"""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),like98vn,10,20 November 2023,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that has not only withstood the test of time but continues to captivate audiences with its compelling storytelling, impeccable acting, and profound exploration of power, family, and the American Dream."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gkeith_1,7,29 December 2019,Spoilers. Observations. Opinions.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),deme1995,1,15 March 2008,"I personally believe that although the godfather got rave reviews, and is generally thought of as the best movie of all time, I didn't care for it. The truth of the matter is that the epic saga insists upon itself. It was predictable, it was depressing without anything really to be depressed about, and lastly, the dancing elves were really quite over the top, and unnecessary. It was arrogant, pompous, and there was really no plot. It was the worst movie I ever saw. It should have taken a lesson from the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles( which was by the way, the best movie of all time). It was atrocious. Also, what was the deal with the birthday party scene in which Al Pachino gets plastered on moonshine with Barbara Bush, or maybe it was Paula Dean. I can't remember which one; I get the two confused. To even compare this to movies such as The Pink Panther, and The Wiz is atrocious. Both of those movies were brilliant compared to this high budget slouch. Even Marlin Brando's benign performance is not enough to bring this movie up to a two star rating."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),d-82284,9,26 March 2020,"I was deeply impressed by two places in this film, one was cold revenge, and the other was warm affection. I always dreamed that when I was about to age, I could have the supreme right to speak like Godfather Corleone. I also dreamed of having a happy family and having fun."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),laurapacino,10,12 June 2018,"Amazing film it is faultless. Brilliantly cast, great story, beautiful soundtrack I can't praise the film enough. A must see!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),drewnes,8,30 May 2021,"There is a reason why this movie is so highly rated: It truly is a work of art. I consider this a cinematic masterpiece. Is it long? Yes. Is that necessary to fully tell this story? Absolutely. Everyone brings their A-game and that's what makes it feel so real. The score is beautifully done and made me want to open a bottle of wine to enjoy while watching this movie. I don't want this to be a spoiler review so I won't talk about character arcs, but the ones that do happen are so good. A must watch for any cinephile out there."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),h5eif1,10,1 February 2022,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yuenyeeac,9,27 March 2020,"The plot of the movie is relatively smooth, a story of a gangster fighting, and how the old godfather abdicated and how actor became a new godfather. Although the story is normal, the development is reasonable and smooth. When mentioning the plot, mention Nolan's Inception. His success is because of his plot, the plot is ups and downs, and the brain is a masterpiece. Compared to the story of Inception, the story of The GoIncepti is more real and closer to life.
In the actor's acting skills, Marlon Brando explained the old godfather's insurmountability, deep eyes, deep voice, and elegant movements. Undoubtedly a textbook-like performance."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mikael_Filo,10,13 May 2024,"It was my father's recommendation to watch this movie, and since then, it has become one of my favorite movies ever. I was a child when I first watched this movie with my father, who shared some details during the film, and I enjoyed it immensely. I have seen it countless times, and it never gets boring. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino delivered masterful performances in this film. I believe this movie is where Al Pacino became one of my favorite actors of all time. The two following movies are extraordinary as well. I remember burning all three movies onto a DVD and keeping them as valuable possessions in my DVD bag."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),langocorum,10,8 September 2022,"I think that the topic, characters, settings... etc all parts of this movie is excellent! I can watch this movie 10000 times. Main character describes some truths about the world! I gave 10 start out of 10. I will watch this movie with my grand grand children :) Firstly people think that it is only a gangster film but it is more than this. It includes the reality of the world, it gives details about the life! Other characters also have a good role play but main character will not be forgotten in the future i think. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marykatw,7,13 May 2021,"I loved the plot,characters, everything about it was amazing. This movie is very iconic!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),goreds,1,1 January 2006,"Let me tell you first and foremost that I have viewed plenty mafia movies, not to mention I own several as well. The first thing I have to say about the Godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab, its almost as the Director is trying to make Americans fall in love with criminals,not to mention a bad display of Italian Americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as Goodfellas. The question we must ask ourselves is""Are Italians really that thick headed and vulgar?"" and the answer is a resounding no. You almost get the impression that Vito Corleone is a homosexual and that James Canns Character has a mental diffieciency. The only good character depicted in the movie was Al Pacinos part. A man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond me.The only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which I thank Francis for"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rod_fuentealba,10,7 January 2018,An extraordinary movie where the protection of the family is first.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moviesfilmsreviewsinc,10,30 May 2022,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to. The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons. ""The Godfather"" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises. Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead. Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can't quite understand unless you've read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sudhirchincholikar,9,28 March 2022,A masterclass in filmmaking. The Godfather is the best film of all time I'd argue the case that it is. This is the ultimate gangster movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pappanlasse,10,8 March 2014,"I have watched this movie at least 15 times and every time I see new things. The story and acting is impeccable. Of course you can see that this movie is not made this Century, but that just adds to the (call it) charm of this movie. Like Sopranos this is more about Family than the violence and mob."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),singhamit-26593,10,10 August 2016,Must watch together with all the 3 parts 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ekirh,10,12 March 2003,Perhaps the best film ever made is an under statement.....
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cleve_mark,10,13 February 2005,"Truly, a flawless masterpiece; and quite possibly, ranking with Citizen Kane, the best movie of all time. I've seen this movie at least 20 times, and feel the need to watch it every six months (along with Godfather Part II...compared to the first two, Godfather Part III is lousy). The cast is simply incredible, particularly Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden, and the actors playing Jack Woltz and Luca Brazi."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sirlion,7,27 July 1999,"This movie is one of the most famous in the history of cinema, but I can't see the reasons. It's true that Marlon Brando plays like a god and that Al Pacino begins to show why he is one of the best living actors... but there are too many dialogues that choke the breath of the movie. There are also some ""holes"" in the screenplay: for instance, why do we see one of the Godfather's sons (Al Pacino) first like a shy guy and then like a determined and blood-thirsty beast? Only because they killed his sicilian wife that he forgets soon to marry another girl? The direction of Coppola is flat: I don't like the way he just throws away the ""crescendo"" of some thrilling scenes and the way he doesn't emphasized the story. Besides after some killings we get to know their ways, so the last killings are ""phoned""... we exactly know what is going to happen and so the surprise goes wasted. Only in the final Coppola succeeds in finding a beautiful alternated editing where he shows the deep contradictions of the members of the Mafia: Michael Corleone is in a Church where he swears to renounce the Devil and in the meanwhile his men are making a massacre. So: a good film but not a masterpiece as many people think."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dan3890-1,1,23 June 2019,"I read all kinds of reviews that call this flick a 'masterpiece'. What kind of masterpiece? I have never seen a masterpiece played on TV every single weekend.
It is always the B movies that are shown that much.
And I love how 1 hour and 5 minutes of commercials are added on to make this a 4 hour movie. Repeat; a 4 hour movie!?!
No, it's not a masterpiece and if it was, it would still not get 4 straight hours of my time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),evilzeke,10,30 July 2022,"Perfect defination of masterpiece . Seeing the world's greatest actors together in their greatest roles ever played . Most perfect acting , set decoration , cinematography , directing and story medium."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),agustindominguezr,8,8 June 2016,"When I watched the movie I had to close my eyes more than fifteen times because in some parts the scenes are very violent. I didn't get when it happened something that it was suppose to indicate the time passing. The script is well done, I think that the movie with a different script would have been very different. The photography is good for the time it was filmed. The actors killed it. I like the music although it was very repetitive. This is a very good movie but it isn't the type of movies I like, it's very violent. The sounds and scenes are very intense, all the sounds are well done according to the time, it would have been interesting if they added more sounds."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lhmcm,10,24 August 2022,"Francis Coppola's crime masterpiece could be the story of any family without the Murder and Bloodshed. It shows audiences what it is like to kill, as well as why someone might do it. Everyone should watch this movie at some point in their lives."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Keemfamerich,7,14 February 2022,Best film ever its so amazing i have enjoyed every step and second in this movie God is great am one of those who did it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brinksnirvana,1,21 May 2001,"The Godfather is a great movie and, in a series of three, the quality didn't diminish.  The second installment won the Oscar for best picture, and it deserved it.  However for those who read the book first, it is all familiar territory. Marlon Brando has only been better in ""On the Waterfront"" and Al Pacino has never been better, that is saying something.  The film is perfect, almost. The book is better than the film and rarely get's mentioned.  Emotion is there, but an age old stereotype get's enforced along the way.  Everything else is perfect and earns the honour of being a true classic.  The problem with the first installment, the second one was somehow better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mohross,10,31 December 2019,THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER. I WILL SEE IT OVER AND OVER.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rally2000,10,4 January 2003,I read the book written by Mario Puzo 10 years ago. The book is one of my favourits. Francis Ford Coppola and his crew has succesfully imagined the story to an outstanding movie. It took me ten years to realize that i was ready to see it. I can't wait ten years too see part two...

It's pure art
The photography , the makeup , the production , the direction , the cast
10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dorMancyx,9,18 August 2021,"Just simply an epic that lives up to it's title. A flawless movie regarding scenery structure, dramatic language, conflicting characters both externally and internally, and epochal reflection. Al Pacino's flawless performance compared to Marlon Brando loses charisma in front of the sophisticated Godfather. The only plot that seemed slightly awkward is the change of Michael at the beginning from ""That's my family"" to the lighter. Other then that, Godfather will be a myth that outlives history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mandusmattsson,10,6 July 2023,"From the first time you glimpse into the life of Don (Vito) Corleone on the big screen all the way until he falls dead towards the latter part the movie keeps its pace. It's gritty but not over the top. It portrays the ugly lifestyle often ignored in media. Inspired by the three families of New York this movie does not disappoint. The handling of rivals, both within the crime sphere, and outside is something only movies such as The Irishman or Godfather 2 can portray. This movie is not only a masterpiece but a milestone of how a good movie should look and feel. The acting, especially that of Marlon Brando, never disappoints and may this movie always act as a way to remember him and what he has done."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aljabman,10,11 October 2020,I've just recently seen The Godfather and it's like eating gum with Italian flavors! There so much culture booming from here to there the wedding party is perfect start and so is the line of daughter being taken advantage as sad as that line was. The crime in this film is for most a epic movie there's guns murder and love. The scene where the narcotics team are getting messed up and they've chose to hurt each other is amazing seeing this people say there not gonna be like the dad and slowly turn evil is something of a masterpiece. This is a great film a master piece.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),downloadzon,9,3 January 2021,"I think nothing more to write about 'Godfather', people have already written a tons of reviews and articles on this cult movie. I think the movie like Godfather is once in a century. All characters and storyline with the best camera work are the milestone and placed in the syllabus of movie making."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bigboynumbers,6,30 May 2024,"In one portion of the movie michael corleone, the son of the godfather travels to Sicily with body guards because he's vulnerable to being victim of other mafia families. He becomes engaged with a woman there where they're together for a considerable period. During that time, his wife becomes the victim of a bomb blast planted in his vehicle via a spy who posed as a bodyguard."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kaibas,1,19 March 2017,"This film is NOT a masterpiece. People are simply over hyping this movie because they know that Hollywood has no other films that are superior to this garbage. When it comes to the actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino etc. It becomes obvious throughout the film that they are just actors and did not work that hard to make falseness look like reality. Their performances were terrible and almost ruined half the film for me. The dialogues were not even original. This film is not realistic. Marlon Brando looks like a coca doodle do. How are these characters even supposed to be gangsters when all they do is just kill other gangsters and help the poor and needy people? That's not the acting of a mafia don! Their performances were NOT believable whatsoever. I could tell that they were acting the whole entire time. Constipated looks on the faces of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. This film is a joke! It's funny how everyone says Godfather (an average film at best) is the greatest film of all time but they don't even give any real reasons. What scenes of the film make it so great in the eyes of the audience?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),niezone,10,10 December 2006,"Amazing acting, amazing direction and screenplay. Marlon Brando at the top of his game with what could be the most recognized performance in movie history. The Godfather introduces us to a very talented cast with a initial wedding scene that presents us with all of the different personalities that are part of the Corleone family. The plot of the movie revolves around Michael Corleone, a role taken by a young Al Pacino personally picked by Francis Ford Coppola even when the studio heads wanted someone else for the role. It was Al Pacino's big break deserving an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor. This movie is first about family, secondly about power and politics and lastly about necessary violence...all summed up to make for a very special movie, one of the best ever, if not the best."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),socialinvasion,10,15 October 2021,"Great movie. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),s991041,10,22 September 2000,"Two words, absolutely perfect. A few more words: The Godfather is (almost) the only movie that has not a single weakness. Perfect acting, perfect cast (Coppola, who wanted Pacino badly), perfect script. Simply the best. Better then all the rest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),StoryCharts,9,15 August 2013,The Godfather is about the idea of family above all other values. It goes about letting us experience this idea with three plots. The main plot is the external plot to Save the Corleone family. Supporting plots include the external plot of Michael becoming an insider of the family and an internal plot of Michael's morality.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gusya-35292,10,19 January 2022,"It was strong! The legendary novel did not deceive my expectations. Heroes, events, reflections on the mafia in politics, in the state - all this became for me like a ""thunderbolt"" for young Michael, who was forced by circumstances to grow up quickly and understand the meaning of the family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ficomano,10,21 November 2018,"Most of the movie addicts would have watched many Don movies, but there is nothing like ""The Godfather"". This is the benchmark movie when it comes to Don movies. Marlon Brando is not just an actor, he is a brand. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this character than Brando. The one punch line ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" will explain how beautiful this movie is. The presence of Brando in this movie is just a pleasure to watch. It's just WOW. He is amazing. Not to forget, what Al Pacino provided in this movie is nothing less than Brando. Overall, this is the best Don movie ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dragojevic-marko,1,28 August 2010,"First i thought that The men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this..... VERY bad movie. I don't care how many people gave it a 10 (don't know why). I want to write my opinion. It is long, boring, a lot of talking, a lot families, names, doing ""buissnes"".... Did i mention that it is boring? The movie lacks a good storyline. It doesn't matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all. There is no comedy, there is very little action, drama (here and there somebody gets killed). I had better fun watching politicians than this."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),the_movie_guy,10,19 December 2001,"This film is so flawless, I don't even feel worthy of reviewing it. There is nothing wrong with this film. It is perfect in every aspect. The only 10 I know of, and because of it, I'll keep watching for more."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ihownow,10,4 March 2022,"A classic movie. This is a movie that left a huge impression on me when I first watched it when I was 15 years old. The godfather character left a deep impression, the actor immersed himself in the role."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sartaj-aulakh91,10,3 March 2024,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, stands as a timeless masterpiece in the world of cinema, captivating audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable performances, and intricate portrayal of the Italian-American Mafia. Behind the scenes, however, lay a web of logistical challenges that, remarkably, did not hinder the film's rise to cinematic greatness."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),arthurwhitcomb,9,20 April 2006,"What makes this movie so good? It's, most fundamentally, and perhaps most subtly, that rich, full, religious-like piety (the kind that's earnest) that it exhibits, for the family, for loyalty in general, for a kind of life of crime that inspires reverence for the criminals rather than condemnation, as if somehow these criminals are martyrs who must do all the dirty work while protecting, or at least pretending to protect, their family and others from it. The movie has a belief in honor and traditionit also has a strong belief in power, though, a commitment to it. The respect for family in these movies is inexorably connected to the inconspicuous (or perhaps conspicuous)celebration of Don Corleone and his son Michael ""doing what it takes,"" acting illicitly as a kind of sacrifice, out of manly volition; in this aspect Michael and his father are like Fortinbras as opposed to Hamlet; by acting decisively they answer Hamlet's ""to be or not to be[?]"" with a firm ""to be."" When they reflect they are more like Hamlet himself, though they do not match Hamlet's scope of thought, but the movie supplies that missing profundity with the diffusive effect which is common to all films as inspired as this one: the look is just right, the pace, the music, the blocking and the photography in general."

Firstly this movie would have been made under 1 hour 30 minutes, most of scenes are just wasting time. Secondly I don't understand why people like this. Is it because of cast or there was no movie like that in 1972. Finally I just want to say this movie is completely overrated. NEVER believe these overrated reviews and comments."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joliet-jake,10,7 December 2004,"this is one of the greatest films ever made. Hands down. If you like movies and have yet to see this film. See it you will not be disappointed. The film has a little something for everyone in it. It follows the book The Godfather by Mario Puzzo. Basically, it is about Don Vito Corelone retiring as head of the family business and handing it to his son Michael. This movie is definitely at the top of my list. It is my favorite of the trilogy with Part 3 in a close second. Every part of this film is perfect. From the acting to the technical aspect. The AFI ranked this movie somewhere in the top five or ten films ever made. In my opinion it should be number one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bali028,10,10 January 2022,Very amazing movie. This movie show you the what real Mafia is doing. It's not about the killing mostly. Must-watch movie. I recommend to everyone. An original.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Golamsayeef,10,31 July 2020,The acting of Marlon Brando overlaped the acting of Al-Pachino. The acting of each character was up to the mark. The story-line was very stretegic and much more facinating comparing to the book.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),blfootball11,4,6 August 2020,"Longest movie I've ever slept through. It's boring and not entertaining. The only realistic thing about this movie is that the mafia spends most of its time sitting, eating and talking. 'The irishman' was long too but it was entertaining and didn't make me want to put a hit out on myself after watching it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),downoncemore,9,25 August 2003,"There is no doubt that The Godfather is one of the cinematic experiences of all time. The Godfather is perfect, and there is no denying that. A story which excites and threats, acting which is convincing on every level and shot in a unique style- so why not 10? For me a 10 movie has to be perfect and mean something to me- this film is perfect but with the wealth of characters and its popularity takes away that special edge. To make a perfect film is an achievement, to make a perfect film with another touch is near impossible. I've only ever once offered a film 10/10 and The Godfather won't be my second. That said, still a brilliant piece of work. 9/10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OrkhanFuladi,10,6 July 2019,"This movie change my life.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karademirt,10,31 May 2020,The best all time marlon branda and al pacino best actors
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jaws-96236,10,21 September 2022,"To say this is a epic movie is a understatement , so well crafted , all actors or at their best
Love the whole movie , but my favourite part is when Michael assassinates the corrupt police Captain and his associate, the tension builds up when he goes to the bathroom struggles to find the concealed Gun and then as the tube train stops in he shoots them both
What a scene great direction and acting 10 stars plus."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TomGunning,10,13 July 2005,"The Godfather if you don't know is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It's brilliant! Brando is great. Pacino is great. De Niro is great. Duvall is great. Sonny is great (although I don't know his name). In fact all the Corleones are great along with all the cast. I'm commenting on all three of the movies as a saga as they're all superb but part 2 is something else as many people agree. You may think I go hard when commenting on this trilogy but seriously, it's excellent. I definitely recommend you to own a copy of The Godfather at least and I'm disappointed that I wasn't born when the movies were released as they would've been quality cinema I think."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),felking,9,23 May 2019,The epic story equaled by only 'once upon a time in America'.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Spedizzo,10,28 November 2003,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my honest opinion. I unfortunately did not see the movie until recently, but I was absolutely swept away by the acting, the drama, and the story. I am Italian, so I felt a weird little bond in there as well. ;)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jahidmirzaa,10,30 December 2023,"\The Godfather (1972) is one of the greatest films ever made. It is an iconic classic that has been revered and loved by fans for decades. The film follows the rise of the Corleone family in the 1940s and 1950s and the struggles they face with the criminal underworld. The story is compelling and the performances are outstanding, particularly Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is masterful and the cinematography by Gordon Willis is breathtaking. The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinema that should not be missed. It is a film that will stay with you forever. Highly recommended."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SimonSaysMC,6,20 November 2019,This movie really suprised me and I enjoyed it and it was really enyoible. But u could change a few things but its good
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benzodrone,5,26 December 2018,"This film is in the top 10 movies of most of my friends. I can see why: it's a very good movie BUT... I higgly dislike the main side effect of this movie and how many people seem to suffer from it: romanticising the mafia, making heroes out of the worst people on the planet. If you think the public is sophisticated enough to see through this and grasp the real message of the film: mafia = evil, Don Corleone is less evil than the others but is still evil, than guess again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hyderhadi,8,10 August 2018,"Cool characters, good story... good acting what do u want more than that?
this film really demonstrate and communicate it's messages very well...what do i want to say is yes watch it,i think it's a worthy film...
p.s: my first review and my English suck..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),daugedaug,10,1 May 2021,"One of the greatest movies ever. Pacino ,Brando, a must see and multiple times."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacknouvion,10,21 February 2006,"This is absolutely the greatest movie ever, together with part 2 en 3 :-) The only vote i can give is (triple) 10. Great actors too, never saw a movie that was so fascinated then this one's about the story of the Corleone's. Even the flashbacks and the early 10's, 20's 30's are masterpieces. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family. This is definitely a ""must see"" masterpiece. Great that they made a part 3 years later with a good role from Andy Garcia."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moonfxstar,9,31 December 2021,I'm forgot how many time i watching this movie. The god father trilogy the best movie ever on 20st century.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LOLw00t,10,26 August 2005,"This is in my opinion, the true classic of American cinema. From the opening to the climax inter-cut with the baptism of Connie Corleone's son you will be riveted to your television screen. This is not, however, a fast-moving mob film like Martin Scorsese's work, but more of a drama. Also unlike Scorsese's work, this is more of a romanticised version of mob life, and you will grow to like the characters better because of this If Mafia films aren't your cup of tea I still recommend The Godfather as it depicts family life as well as Family life, showing how Don Vito keeps his family together through good and bad. In one word I would describe this film as - epic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MarlonWelles,10,25 February 2005,"The Godfather Saga is the best story ever. With respect to George Lucas and his Star Wars series, There is nothing better then a story about money, power, and respect in an American setting. The series starts with Part 1, The Godfather, which is in the same category with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Searchers, and Schindler's List as the best movie of there respected Genres. As good as Marlon Brando is in this film, I think that his best film was On the Waterfront and this is his last goodbye. I realize that Last Tange in Paris was a great performance, but the Godfather was an icon for generations to come. Al Pacino in this film is absolutely superb and he only made it better in Part II. Many people put The Godfather as the number 1 movie of all time and I can't argue with that because of all that it has to offer. I think that Citizen Kane is more of a landmark because of all the things that Orson Welles brought to cinema from that movie, but if that is number 1, than Coppola has no shame in being the best number 2 of all time. The amazing thing about the Godfather Saga is that I think the world of Part 1, but I think that Part 2 is better. Bravo Francis, you have made your mark on Film forever, no doubt."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bcapello-53699,10,24 May 2018,Best mafia film i have ever seen. Truely a masterpiece done to the T. As prevalent in relating the true nature of the mafia as such films as Goodfellas and company but every aspect of this film is so meticulously done.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kallieurbach,8,31 July 2022,"I highly enjoyed this movie. Title is perfect for the context of the movie. Therefore, I rate this movie 8 stars! This American Crime film was a pleasure to watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AbdullahAAZ,6,9 June 2020,"I've never been so bored in my life like when i watched this movie. I started watching it with a big expectations due to what people say about it . But at the end, i ended up forcing my self to finish it. maybe because it's too old ? i don't know. The only good thing was the acting for sure. The main actor was a phenomenon."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thrillhouse678,1,6 August 2001,"this movie was more boring than church! they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody! Michael Corleone is a little girly man! and that Sonny guy, no one intimidating is named Sonny! when he got blown to bits, i laughed....hard! Then there's Vito! What's with this guy? Does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth? why does he look like that? and what's with that name...Vito? who names thier son after a presidential command! it could only be one typed of people, hillbillies. Italian Mafia hillbillies. If you want a real good movie go see Santa With Muscles! he'll stop them Corleones! "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Boro_Fan_Brad,10,19 May 2004,"I'm not too good at elaboration, so I'll keep this short and sweet - The Godfather is quite simply the greatest film ever made. Superb cast, superb acting, superb filming, superb directing, superb story...if you watch this film your life will be bettered. Al Pacino's career best performance, Marlon Brando's career best performance, and superb supporting turns from James Caan, Robert Duvall et al ensure that Francis Ford Coppola's greatest film will forever go down as a classic, the greatest film ever. Based on the classic novel ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo. I advise that you read that - it's absolutely fantastic, and the film stays nigh on 100% faithful to the novel. Go watch. Now."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BenedictS100,10,20 May 2021,The Godfather (parts one and two) is as good as the book. Even if it is a tiny bit dated it is an amazing story!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),astor_rz,10,17 December 2013,"(Short overall review) I watched ""The Godfather"" in 2013. It was broadcast Sunday evening at 20:00 and the sequel and prequel followed after one week each. At the time, my most favorite movie was only one. Even though I had watched numerous classics and modern films (Lord of the rings, Starwars, etc) I could only say ""This is my favorite movie"" to one production. But after I watched ""The Godfather"" the number increased. To say anything bad for this film will be an abomination. I have given several 10s in IMDb, to films I like, but I have always realized that if this was an official review I couldn't give 10 to any of them. That is not true for this one. This film truly deserves a 10 and will remain on the top of my list of the greatest movies of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Samadgr,10,14 January 2020,"This movie will remain the best in history... This is A lesson in film-making and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sa-kawel,10,11 December 2005,"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),matthewpadraic,9,16 November 2014,"The late great Gordon Willis changed cinematographer forever in this classic film. Ordinarily during this time, an eye light was routinely used on the lead actor in order to better expose the eyes: an important part of the performance. To the dismay of the studio executives, Willis decided to let Marlon Brando's eyes fall into shadow, creating an ominous cinematographic look that is indelibly inscribed into the consciousness of filmmakers. Since his contribution to cinematography, we now embrace a much more naturalistic approach to lighting which has allowed for interesting photography to flourish."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Roozbeh-Kalbasi,10,8 September 2023,"The GODFATHER is one of the best movies I've ever seen, as a director I can say this movie is an incredible film in terms of the production date. The way that actors perform in this movie is insane and brain blowing. The story makes a lot of sans and it's well written."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),logjammin,10,20 May 2003,"undoubtebly the best movie ever and godfather part 2 is easily the second best and im sick of people saying part 3 is s*** its not that bad it easily should be in the top 50 movies ever . marlon brando by the way is easily the best actor ever without question his acting in on the waterfront ' the godfather, and apocalypse now was second to none. al pacino and robert deniro are the next best without question you only have to watch movies like dog day afternoon , scarface,taxi driver, raging bull,scent of a women ,heat, the deer hunter, not to mention their roles in the godfather"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),schumifan78,4,11 November 2007,"Just another violent gang movie, whats the big deal? I hate these sort of movies about mafia guys going around with guns thinking they are all tough, put them in a ring one on one with Tyson and see how tough they are. I Don't understand why this movie is so praised, Whats the big deal? There is enough violent gang movies around, what makes this one special? There are so many movies better than this one out there, don't waste your time with this. I suppose there must be lots of fans of this movie like there is for lots of other violent pointless ****house movies such as Sin City and the likes, I guess this just highlights that there must be fairly big problems in our society today, why would anyone find this sort of negative and pointless junk enjoyable? The way that this sort of thing is portrayed in movies as being ""cool"" is really quite sickening, I wonder how many people who have had personal experience with murder and violence would find this sort of thing enjoyable, not many I would say. If you think you are going to get anything worthwhile out of this movie think again, your life will not be enriched in any way by watching this, spend the three hours out enjoying the sunshine or talking to your friends and family or something instead..."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Devonwaggoner,10,5 December 2023,"Classic movie that could never get old. A lot of life lessons can be learned by watching. After watching come back and tell what you have learned. One thing that I learned was to stay true and loyal to family, do not speak outside the family or tell people what you are thinking. Marlon Brando did such and amazing Job I just wish that he collected his award when they won. But instead he had someone come pick his award up. I understand cause he only did it to piss frank Sinatra off lol. This movie has so much history. Also watch the offer on paramount plus it's all about the making of the God Father."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dhish,10,28 July 2022,The best gangster film I've seen in my life. This is the reference for most of the gangster movies made in my language. The dialogues in the movies are great. And the MUSIc is just WOW! Background score is great!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pulimelodia,10,29 October 2017,"THIS MOVIE IS A WORK OF ART. Everything in this is perfect: perfect direction, perfect script, perfect actors, perfect music, perfect photography, it's just perfect. With this film it was discovered Al Pacino who makes an incredible character. I also think it's one of the most realistic movies I've seen since it's based on the Italian mafia and a character is constantly dying, more than one death can make you cry. And it's realistic because unfortunately that happens in reality. What else can I say about this movie: it is simply PERFECT."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),teknoprojenet,10,18 June 2023,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film tells the story of the powerful Corleone family and their involvement in the world of organised crime."

""The Godfather"" grossed more than $200 million worldwide, or $2.7 billion today. The Godfather is based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. ""The Godfather"" still ranks second on the IMDB, behind ""Shawshank Redemption."". The Godfather also won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. It's really a classic."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kitevar,9,19 January 2022,"An important place in the history of the economy is occupied by the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United Weather in search of a new, more efficient life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinian dons.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),paulcorleone,10,14 June 2001,"It breaks my heart to see poeple knock around the godfather and think to themselves that the general public goes along with them.  Those who say the Godfather has bad acting, too long, pointless, badly directed and boring should take a look at the movies we see today.  Instead of knocking around a masterpiece (which does deserve a place in the top 100 movies at the top ten not scream or something along those lines) just go listen to your pointless death metal music.  One person said they couldn't find the link between a masterpiece and the movie.  He said it had a great plot and excellent acting but he must've had a mind block for anything else. I'll tell you what else the music, cinematography, presentation, the script, the book it was based on and how well it was adapted.  Now alot of people say that goodfellas is better.  Sure its very entertaining and puts a glorified twist on the world of the mafia but it aint no masterpiece.  I'll tell you what's boring star wars without all the special effects."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zsigomiklos,10,13 July 2007,"I have seen Godfather a number of times, but I had to buy the DVD collection as I need it near at hand. The more watching gives a full-scale experience. I could say, I became a Godfather addict. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),awaisakram15,10,4 April 2014,"Movie is just Love! The remarkable thing is that the first priority of Godfather is his family. Movie is just telling you how do you gain respect in your life but without family everything is useless. The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts, while Brando's cotton-cheeked patriarch represents everything about old Hollywood that Coppola aspired to. The younger generation is represented by the then fresh, exciting talents who remain respected names in their profession (Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Diane Keaton). This is a film that has entered popular culture: even if you've never seen it, you know the lines (""Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes""), and some of the scenes (the horse's head). But there's more to it than moments imprinted on the psyche"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ramonvasquezjr,10,26 September 2002,"A ten by far. One of the greatest pieces of film ever to be created. Nothing can compare to it's magnitude. Perfect. Brando's greatest performance along with Pacino and Coppola. Like it's title it is the ""Godfather"" of all films. A template for all films to follow."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RadiSadek,8,4 August 2015,"OK so The Godfather is an entertaining movie. OK, so it has some nice music, decent acting, and a gripping plot. All in all, I'm secure enough to state that it is an OK movie. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Hobbes2002-1,10,25 January 2004,"Perfect.  That is the only word that can truly describe this epic.  Truly one of the few films that deserved a Best Picture oscar.  Coppola and Puzo have given us a story that is at a shakesperean level.  Honor, Family, Loyalty, these are what is important to these characters and you see it. The characters are so real that you communicate with them.  I found myself talking to them and yelling at them.  You feel for these people.  Truly this is more than a movie, this more than a film, this is the epitome of what all movies should be."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nealklein,10,16 October 2000,"Many reviews talk about the genius evidenced in this masterpiece of ""gangster"" movies. Of course, it really is a family movie, with a story set in the gangster world. What can I add that has not been said already? The simple fact that this classic captures the family dynamic that is practically gone from movies of the last 20 years."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrtunga-1,10,21 November 2016,"The Godfather I-II is far the best film ever. It's the per excellence for cinema in terms of narrative, acting, technique, and visibility. Some might argue that it is nor revolutionary, for example, such as The Citizen Cane. I totally agree with that argument that the GodFather I-II is not revolutionary in terms of narrative and form. Yet, but what it perfectly does is to combine all the virtues and improvements of cinematography, and raise them to an advanced level. At its time, it seems it's the end of cinema in terms of perfection. Moreover, it paved the way for the emergence of a new breed of actors such as Robert DE Niro, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Taila Shire, Diane Keaton. It made Robert Duvall a power player in Hollywood Cinema, and gave a legend, Marlon Brando a chance to make an honorable leave that he unfortunately did fail to use. Regarding direction, Coppola set the standards for perfect directing. "

I immediately asked my Italian friends, if that could be possible..... they said...""yes, in the 'old' days...not as many cops,and no forensic stuff available then to get caught!"" However, some things weren't realistic...such as...Michael's naive wife(Diane Keaton) constantly interfering(he would have gotten rid of her,long ago)and Sonny getting caught by himself, on the causway...you 'always' take somebody with you, (men can't avoid to be careless)... Anyway... a great film...a collectors' item..now for sure...."

It's more ambitious, it's more elegiac, it delves deeper into the soil of Italian-American myth, plus... what were they thinking of, trying to match the critical and commercial dynamite of the first film? The Godfather Part II was, from conception upwards, an insane project. But it worked.
When I watched this movie I was amazed that how Robert de Niro nailed the role of Don Vito Corleone. It could be a pressure for any actor to play a role of it has been played by a famous and good actor before. And most problem to play younger Don was that it was played by the god of cinema: Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),blumdeluxe,9,6 December 2016,"The Godfather was one of the great films that I still failed to watch, so lately I took the advantage and gave it a try. There is so much written and said about this movie already that you should probably go far more into the film to really get all the points that make this title as lasting as it has proved to be. But I'll try to sum up what went through my mind as a viewer without further knowledge of the background and making of The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saurabhgautam-02891,7,23 December 2017,Lovely work All team and supporting artists.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lvb53,1,24 April 2007,"Okay, so I've seen this now and I began asking myself, how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at IMDb and how come everyone loves this movie? I've seen this and, it's horrible. I fell asleep after watching two hours of this. This and Pirates of the Caribbean is the only movies I've fallen asleep to, seriously, and yet it's so unrealistic, like when Don Corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives. You would die after two shots from those types of guns also."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rrusso4231,10,6 January 2001,"The Godfather,1972, is the movie by which other mob classics are compared to. Although not categorized as a ""Mob Movie"", it is what all other mob movies are compared to. the story is great, the acting unsurpassed. By the time the movie ends you are rooting for the ""bad guys"", the Corleone family. Other great movies such as Goodfellas, Casino, Bugsey etc. are good, fun and entertaining, these latter movies show the lower level mobster, whereas the Godfather shows what life is like if you are on the top of the syndicate ladder. Keep in mind that as great as this movie is in real life the mob's retirement plan isn't all that great!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sparrtacus,9,6 August 2001,"A masterpiece is just about all there is to say about this film. A cinematic jewel who's only competition is its own sequel. The Godfather is probably the most quoted (and spoofed) movie in history. Every single thing about this film is perfect. The home-movie feel, the cast, the crew- everything. What more is there to say? 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),danybelina,9,18 October 2023,"The Godfather is a true cinematic gem that will forever remain in the history of cinema. A score of 9, in my opinion, cannot reflect the depth and skill of this film, but it is as an attempt to express my admiration and respect for it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),buckeyes-05926,10,17 April 2024,"Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be expect for one. As for the storytelling, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass. A perfect film with one singular flaw which is it sequel somehow is better then it. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character, and more than a few minor ones, is molded into a distinct, complex individual. With each actor absolutely nailing the role. Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world. Would be considered the greatest movie of all time if it was not for its squeal."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cabalistvis,10,4 October 2016,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Kamran2usa,10,9 October 2022,"This story, complete with the Oscar winning performances in both acting and special effects is perfect for those in need of a dose of goodness. My family enjoys watching Forrest Gump together for rejuvenation, to view someone with true values of honesty, friendship and family. Forrest, with his heart of gold and his low IQ, never gives up. He always looks for the best in every scenario. The movie opens with a feather floating down over the city, landing at Forrest's feet. Near the end of the story, Forrest questions, ""Do we each have a destiny - or do we just float around accidental, like on a breeze?"" As you are contemplating this question, the feather reappears and floats through the countryside right up into the ending credits."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mitch-25,10,8 March 2002,"Behind Schindler's List, this is my second all-time favorite movie.  It is so rich in detail, and style, and acting.  EVERYTHING that is on the screen has a purpose, and EVERY bit of dialog is important.  If not at the moment, then a few frames later.  It is without a doubt the best movie in the mob genre.  If it wasn't for this movie, movies like Goodfellas, and Casino could NEVER have been made.  "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pm_stokes,1,9 November 2021,". . . why this movie gets such high ratings. It's a great story, but Coppola's criminal lack of attention to detail and continuity is insulting and Talia Shire's, James Caan's, Marlon Brando's and Diane Keaton's amateurish performances are distracting and laughable. Neither of them can act at all. Watch it again and I'm sure you'll agree."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hoernkeem,10,6 September 2022,"'The Godfather' is a classic American film from 1972 directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on the novel by Mario Puzo. The film has gone down in cinematic history, and is lauded as one of the greatest American films ever made. Not only was it the highest grossing film of 1972, but it went on to win three Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Marlon Brando who famously declined the award. Along with Brando the film stars numerous actors who went on to become household names such as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and James Caan among others."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),graemepepper,9,6 April 2020,"Few words required to review the first of the trilogy. Classic is predictable however the most appropriate. I personally prefer Pacino's performance in this one, many will prefer part two. Masterful performance from Brando and if Jimmy Caan was ever better I'd like to know. Great story, Great acting and Great direction I can't say anything that's not been said before. But I can confirm."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amit_wadhwa,9,25 November 2018,The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kierliv,7,4 July 2018,"It's no secret that this is one of the best movies of all time, and any praise that I could bestow upon it will have invariably already been said. The ensemble cast carries forward an amazing plot that perfectly balances the allure of these characters with the dark realities of running a mob. I do have just one point of contention. I can not for the life of me figure out why the plot had Michael Corleone hiding out in Italy, taking him out of the action to put him in a marriage that goes largely no where. He arrives back home and I found myself thinking ""Why did that happen? How did that serve the plot?"", a question I have been unable to answer to this day."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidreddevilshaw,1,19 November 2023,Well I've just watched supposedly the best ever mafia film EVER The Godfather well all I can say is WHAT A PILE OF GARBAGE seriously people rank that higher than Goodfellas jog on will ya. I've just lost 175 minutes of my life that I'm never getting back. I'm not watching the second one unless someone pays me a lot of money. What was good about it really apart from the end credits I don't know. The horse head in the bed was sort of cool but other than that it was a load of garbage. If anyone tells you to watch this say you want paying to watch it because it's not worth 5 minutes of your time let alone 3 whole hours.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ali-ammad,10,23 July 2016,"Godfather is awesome. It is one of the movies which inspired me to give time to my family. As the Godfather has said, ""a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real men"", this movie made me think that family is so important. No matter what is your business, you must spend time with your family. And don't even ask me about the acting. Marlon Brando is really a Godfather. His acting was one of the best of all times. And this movie is the reason that I started watching Al Pacino's movies. He is the greatest actor I have ever seen. He is a legend. And the way he acted in all parts of Godfather, I don't have any words to praise him. He is the Godfather of Hollywood."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OldMagnumPI,10,30 May 2019,I remember this one the first time I saw it. When and where .... I was glued to the tv at the time. I asked my father before is it any good cause I saw it in the tv guide and he said the famous words ....! The horse's head. So I watched it late ad night on a small tv in my bedroom when I was 13 years old and the rest is history.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aoi_kdr,10,22 June 2019,"I could find several parts what the mafia philosophy and the manly sentiments are.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidmvining,10,6 August 2023,"This is one of those titans of cinema. A film so large and firmly ensconced in the collective consciousness of the film world that one does not speak against it and get taken very seriously. Well, I'm not going to speak against that consensus. Not because I cannot think for myself, but because I see Francis Ford Coppola's work bringing Mario Puzo's kinda trashy mobster novel to film and find a film of such craft and care in its construction at every level, all in service towards a central tragedy, that I cannot deny the immense achievement that The Godfather is. It's something of a fulcrum film, vacillating between the precise classical construction that Hollywood had steadily built over decades with the more explicit treatments of sex and violence."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),weaponx-mask,10,3 February 2017,"This movie is awesome. Don Vito Corleone character was amused. I really liked the concept very much. The movie represents the real Gang type of thing. The godfather scenario. The other parts of godfather movies are also very good.The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The Al Pacino character was also a strong character. Overall its a great movie to watch.It spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. Worth the full time of watching. Deserves a rating 10 from me. Christopher Nolan is the boss."

Also there are lot of nonsense I found and I thought I was crazy as in.. Am I really the only one who thinks this makes no sense? This is what I mean:
1. Who in their right mind will go and ask a favor of the big shot mafia boss not only the same day but at the exact same time of his daugter's wedding?"

GOD FATHER stands head and shoulder above the rest.The story is full of vivid imagination and given birth to a new genre of Crime/Gangster version. Which before GOD FATHER was a taboo subject and considered to be destined doom."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),varshil-11759,10,2 April 2021,This film is 49 years old. But you watched this film and you 1% not regretted beeelieve it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),laminhmd290,9,10 January 2017,"the greatest crime show i have ever seen. The godfather is a tale about revenge, betrayal,love and hustle. On this hand, A powerful and rich family. An Organized crime empire passed down from father to son. On the other hand, Other ruthless powerful rival families. Special thanks to Al-Pacino and Robert De Niro. Some of the greatest Actors of our time.The motion picture (in view of a script labored over for quite a while by Puzo and afterward at last given frame, I think, by executive Francis Ford Coppola) gets a similar vibe. We have a tendency to relate to Don Corleone's family not on the grounds that we burrow group wars, but rather in light of the fact that we have been with them from the earliest starting point, watching them sit tight for the fight to come while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper containers. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ohiodude,10,8 June 2013,"I am not the first, nor last to watch The Godfather and be utterly intoxicated by what is on the screen. When I first saw this film 8 years ago, I was entranced by the colorful characters, the Nino Rota score, the story and the saga. But every viewing since then brings something new. The nuanced performance of an unassuming but unflinchingly confident Al Pacino. Every time I think that they almost cast Jack Nicholson, I can't help but wonder. The way the wedding scene at the beginning lulls the audience into a sense of family, tradition and honor before putting all of it to the test in the remaining 2 hours of run time. There is no better example of crime film, drama film and acting combined with writing. The lines are rich and quotable. There is no scene that is superfluous. And once you see it, you will want to see it again and again and you will notice things every time you see it. Rarely does a filmmaker bring together this caliber of actors that bring together their characters with such color and vitality. You feel for every character on the screen and for every character who departs from the family. You feel almost that this is your family, too. That is the investment that can be made in this film....to lose one's self in its depths."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ines_fr,9,8 April 2020,This movie is absolutely marvellous.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),prinaloberoi,8,9 November 2023,"Pure Mafia family drama film ""The godfather"". The wish to see mafia family drama film got fulfilled by this film. The perception of the maker reached to the audience through this film. These film can be watched as many times as I can. Many tries to make film on mafia but nobody can make so far. Tremendous team work. And of course perfect casting by the makers. I always suggest people to watch this film. As good films should reach to the people who are enthusiastic and get motivated. Complete film containing family drama, dealing, ethics, enemy and love for family. Again recommending to watch this film and write a review."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),visualizainc,6,11 August 2014,"I try to find an old animation movie that I watched as a kid on TV in the 90s (it could be older) and made an enduring impression on me. I remember the ending most vividly: a bloody battle on the top of a hill where two armies clashed, apparently led by a man and a woman inside cyborgs or some kind of robotic vehicle. These two seemed to share a history (fling?? / siblings??) and confronted each other beside a nearby river. They both died. The movie ended tragically with a shot of the great tree on the top of the hill, surrounded by corpses of both armies.. "

The film follows the rise of the Corleone family in the 1940s and 1950s and the struggles they face with the criminal underworld. The story is compelling and the performances are outstanding, particularly Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is masterful and the cinematography by Gordon Willis is breathtaking. The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinema that should not be missed.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saigontourism,10,12 December 2023,"The Godfather is a masterpiece of American cinema that transcends the genre of crime drama. It is a sweeping saga of family, loyalty, power, and corruption that spans decades and continents. The film boasts a stellar cast, led by Marlon Brando as the aging patriarch of the Corleone crime family, and Al Pacino as his reluctant heir. The film also features memorable performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is superb, creating a rich and immersive atmosphere that draws the viewer into the complex and violent world of the mafia. The screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's novel, is full of memorable dialogue and unforgettable scenes. The cinematography by Gordon Willis is stunning, using shadows and contrasts to create a visual style that matches the mood and tone of the story. The music by Nino Rota is haunting and iconic, adding to the emotional impact of the film. The Godfather is not only a great film, but a cultural phenomenon that has influenced generations of filmmakers and audiences. It is a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by anyone who loves cinema."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),euclidsbc,10,20 January 2006,"Everyone here have watched the movie, so I will save the effort to describe the movie again. After all, this movie is brilliant! One thing I like Don Vito Corleone is that he beat (though not depicted in the movie) the s**t out of the two punks who used violence on a girl. Nowadays, too many Americans ONLY blame other people or other things like they are the ONLY innocent ones. They kill because the video games are so violent, they steal because they cannot find a job paying them $30/hour to let them be a slacker, they sexually abuse minors because they are under control of the drug or alcohol, they are fat because the food is too delicious to resist. As a grown-up person, everybody should be responsible for his own wrongdoings. The video games will not open the TV by themselves, the alcohol or drug will not go into the body by itself and the delicious food will not go straight from the deep fryer into the stomach. This is a lesson I learned from Godfather, which is especially valuable in a world full of selfishness and cowardice."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),arpitjain-98514,9,1 July 2017,"While the plot of this movie is amazing, star cast is outstanding, cinematography and background music are masterpieces in themselves - the part which I like the most about this movie is how perfectly it depicts the influence of the cultural during those days over the society. The fine and minute details of lavishing lives of these underworld mafias, suppression of even elite women in almost every class of society and a lot more is put forth by this movie. The movie is full of twists and holds on to the audience. Your adrenaline level can be fairly high during these three and a half hours of your live. A must watch."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),360EntPro,9,21 April 2023,"An engaging crime drama. When it comes to the outstanding performances of the key actors, The Godfather lives up to its reputation. You can feel the emotional weight, and the second half contains some truly moving moments. Although not presented in the most theatrical way, the father-son relationship is a key feature and is brought to life by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances. The movie's one flaw is that it moves too slowly to get to the point. It doesn't get monotonous, but I think the first 90 minutes could've been handled better because the second half is much better. The tensions become more intense, the settings become heavier, and the characters seem more significant. The second half contains some activity."

Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."

The first time I saw it I was blown away by the acting. Marlon Brando especially, his character's voice really makes him unique and fun to watch. Al Pacino is a war hero and the youngest son of three, he comes home for his sister Connie's wedding. And the godfather's daughter's wedding day is the most important to him. Like said, this movie is a must see and I highly encourage everyone who has not seen it to see it as soon as possible, classic movies like these never get old."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),VitoCorleone666,10,22 January 2004,"I have always been a sucker for mafia movies and ""Goodfellas"" has always been my favorite but I now must change my mind. I have seen The Godfather now about ten times or so and the movie grows on me more each time I watch it. I pick up little things that I didn't notice every time and to me the movie gets better and better each time as well. The storyline changes so much and I hardly notice that it is three hours long. I would have to say that I don't think there will ever be a film that could ever come close to The Godfather. They just don't make them like they used to."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),agastyasinha,10,30 December 2020,This is a very good movie I really liked it and I love the storyline of this mlvie
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stephenwhitworth-26755,9,23 May 2020,The story is enough of an attraction but looking back at this years after first watch it in the Cinema Al Pacino's performance can be seen for the brilliant actor he is.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),i-79629,9,17 May 2020,"The film gave me a very different feeling. Splitting the ""Godfather"" apart, each small piece is actually bland, but when these bland small pieces are combined together, they produce such a huge magic force. Real emotions are the foundation, there is no pretentiousness, no exaggeration. Just like our real life, people are very sensitive to reality."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mateusbox,10,4 January 2021,"Everyone does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."

Movie gonna make your mind blast"

What can i say. The oranges or orange color when someone dies is
something that you cannot forget if you see it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dcc21,10,11 December 1999,"In my opinion, easily one of the top five movies of all time.  I believe every person should sit down and watch not only this film, but the second and third ones as well."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),silinpavelpk,10,19 January 2022,"'The Godfather' is not a movie title. This is the name of a great picture that won three Oscars, laid the foundation for an epoch-making epic about the Corleone family, rethought gangster cinema as a genre in particular and revolutionized all cinema in general. Why is this work of 1972 so great and why is it still loved and watched?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JDR_2001,10,20 March 2023,The Godfather is one of if not the most perfect movie ever made. The acting is phenomenal Marlon Brando and Al Pacino deserve the highest praise for their roles in this movie. The story is a bit slow at first there is a lot going on in the begining but it soon speeds up and get really exciting. Some of the best quotes are from this movie and some of the best scenes too. What is crazy about this movie is 50 years later it is still relevant and is still just as popular as it was back in 1972. The movie is timeless and will never not be popular. The score is also amazing here the theme song is so good as well.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sheldonABC,10,12 June 2020,"An ordinary man, who broke his throat and couldn't find a serious listener, but the slurred godfather, no one dared to ignore every word he said. He is always expressionless, but there is a power that cannot be ignored behind him-an elegant rage, calm cruelty, and makeup evil, like a mixture of viper and tiger."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cobaints,9,27 July 2022,"Amazing film / amazing cast / amazing writers / amazing production / amazing everything, 100% ahead of its time. Just breathtaking. Can't add anything that hasn't already been said about this picture."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),arjunflamingfeather,10,27 July 2018,"Italian Mafia who kill and go rich; government takes their money. No credits to this cast and crew but at the Awards. The story did not need to ring a bell in memory but movie reviewers like to seat in chairs with no cushions and watch 'The Godfather'. 
Review to the movie is that the further research into films that is done; the analytic is that light their was impressionistic. The shoot in movies are with lights in the backdrop that are with people and barricades; no photography without permission. 
It is not allowed to publish or view these contents that are from backstage and the reasons are unavoidable because the crew spent their work in preserving that truth that should be viewed at cinema halls or in digital video devices. On the television the story of the 'Godfather' is featured with the set of box. Plugging in to the channel proves validly that watching 'The Godfather' starring Marlon Brando as 'Godfather' will not lead to him adopting a child from us. 
Recommending 'The Godfather' to viewers because it is a Marlon Brando film and books have been written on the former and latter."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CinemaSerf,7,28 May 2023,"When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious ""Corleone"" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),greenslingdk,5,21 July 2020,"Yes, this film is most definitely positively something id watch again and again and again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Hannibal Bates,9,4 December 2000,"Francis Ford Coppola's movie about the Corleone family is the story of the ultimate Hollywood family. Although ""The Godfather"" has lost some of it's original steam. In 1972 the causal treatment of violence was beyond shocking. With films like ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Goodfellas"" & ""Pulp Fiction"" (any Tarantino film for that matter) savage violence done in an ""every day life"" manner is no longer as shocking. Although there are a few scenes that stand out, even today. When Michael Corleone paid back those gentlemen for the attempted murder of his father. That is one of the greatest scenes in the history of film. And of course the scene were one of Mr. Ed's comrades makes a cameo. The most amazing thing to myself is how much of a family this really is. The Corleone's love each other, and that shines through above everything else in this film. But even with all it's greatness it lasted too long. So this great film just doesn't make the 10 cut for me. 9 (would be 9.8) out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hero_lms_here,10,7 January 2017,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. The assassination scene is one of the best scenes ever made and you don't forget it. Its not a movie about criminal life or just mafia wars its a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable.Its a perfect movie The music, the acting, everything. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role. fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters Do not miss this film!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),crazypigkiller9-1,10,19 April 2007,"There's too many good things I could say about this movie so I'm going to try to make this short and sweet. Plus most of the other reviews here are long and go into all the details. This movie is fantastic, it is one of if not the greatest flick of all time. It completely annihilates most of the movies of its time and even though it was made in the early 70's it is still better than most any movie that has come out since then. Powerful acting, powerful direction, perfect amount of violence and gore and one of the best stories ever written in my opinion. Sheer brilliance. A stunning masterpiece. One of Al Pacino's best and its an understatement to say that he has a LOT of stellar performances. With an all star cast and not a single bad scene in the entire film i'd have to say that this is one of those few ""perfect"" films. I have a hard time differentiating a favorite between the first and second movie in the trilogy, but if I absolutely had to it would probably be the first one. The third one was good but pales in comparison to the first two. I have seen very few movies in my day that can compare to this film. If for some reason you haven't seen it and are looking for a powerhouse of a film, this is it. Immediately go out and get it, you will not be disappointed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mauzer9191,10,17 November 2021,"Best movie ever created. Full of little details and action. Never gets boring even for a minute. THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nath-92208,10,14 January 2020,"This movie is Ford Coppola at his iconic, captivating and world building best. Vito Corleone is such an intriguing and interesting character to see on screen, which is just one of the many reasons that this movie's 2h 57m runtime flies by."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Heitorms12,10,8 March 2023,"The Godfather is a classic American crime film that has captured the hearts and minds of generations of moviegoers. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, this epic masterpiece tells the story of the Corleone family, one of the most powerful and feared mafia families in New York City."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dsalouk,10,6 February 2017,"The Godfather set the tone for generations of film after it; through directing, acting, the power of music, and the power of culture. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully creates a small world within America, where the Italian culture permeates and adapts to the world around it. Brought to life by giants like Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, and juxtapositioned against an alienated Al Pacino, who evolves his character to a point where he finally shoulders and carries the film. The music is so wonderful to the time the film is set in, and is a character in and of itself, marking distinct scenes into immortality. The Godfather is a film built out of perfection, and easily stands the test of time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eternalyrith,10,2 December 2019,"Overestimated,

They didn't explain what illness the old Don Corleone had, didn't show the deaths of other family owners ... and the party scenes could be much smaller, and could have more intense dialogues..."

From start to finish, with Coppola's incredible directing skills, a just downright brilliant a screenplay and incredible acting, it is no wonder many consider this is the greatest film of all time. Even as 12 year old watching this, I can still truly understand how amazing this film is. Every shot has significance and with instantly quotable and amazing lines. I can't even put into words how much I loved this film. And after watching it about five times now, I can't find any flaws in the narrative or directing. I can't even find the words to describe how amazing this is and how much I loved it, but that was my attempt. Thank you, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for this masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),acipoyo,10,26 June 2001,"I still don´t get how it took so long to have this movie on DVD, specially considering all the crap it´s been ""burned"" nowadays. Anything anyone could say about this movie will be hopelessly short. And I wonder why? I mean, how come a mob family novel became an obliged reference of movie making? It´s not certainly the only mob movie neither mob movie masterpiece. But, there is the fine balance between poetry and crime, honor and reckless vengeance. There are the unforgettable lines at the precise time that make this film so believable, so close to everyone that makes you fall in love with Don Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. There is pain, love, crime, vengeance and the greatest solitude of the powerful man that has to lie to his beloved wife."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kelvin20810,7,23 February 2005,"After spending three hours to watch the film, I think it was a good way to study violence, power and honor. Also the justice and crime in America."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),supernma,10,13 June 2010,"What do we think of when we think of ""The Godfather""? Intense shoot-outs and violence, beautiful scenery, sets, costumes, and cinematography, Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal as the menacing Don Vito Corleone, maybe even the final shot of the film, which speaks volumes. No matter what you think of when you think of ""The Godfather"", you think of greatness."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),harshkotafactory,9,29 June 2021,A fine example of what a great piece of storytelling and cinematography can be. Al Pacino is the center piece of the whole plot which revolves around Marlon Brandon.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EugeneOL,7,24 April 2020,"People often compare ""The Godfather"", which in many ways is thought of as the original crime drama, with many others that have come since(namely Goodfellas). However, I have yet to see one of these films surpass the original Godfather; it really is as great as everyone says it is."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sayedmuhammadmusa,1,19 July 2022,"I really don't understand why some people loved it so much. I agree acting by all actors is outstanding, but this movie is about a crime family and it glorifies the criminals of the society. Criminals are volves of society which prey upon sheep (good people) of the society,they use evil and immoral ways to become rich and powerful. Criminals must not be glorified. Please stop promoting such crime movies. All crimes movies should show a terrible fate of criminal who either has to spend rest of life in jail or is given suitable puinishment for his or her crimes. I did not live the movie as it glorifies lifestyle of criminals."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dr_Death666,8,6 July 2009,"If you're wondering why I put exclamation points after the headline, it's because I thought this movie was just another overrated pile of junk. Man was I wrong! This movie was quite good. Sure it isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely in my Top 250! This should definitely replace boring THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as #1 in the Top 250. It's about the Corleone family's criminal empire run by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and trying to pass it on to his son Michael (Al Pacino) You shouldn't watch this movie if you are under age 16 though. It's quite violent and no one under that age would understand it anyway. Definitely watch this movie. It is very well done."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),asmaazahran,9,1 December 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a towering achievement in the realm of cinema. This 1972 classic has garnered widespread acclaim for its exceptional storytelling, rich character development, and unforgettable performances. The film delves deep into the complex dynamics of power, loyalty, and family within the world of organized crime. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of extraordinary, and the film's atmospheric cinematography and haunting score add another layer of brilliance. It's a true masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences and remains a timeless classic. Trust me, you won't want to miss out on experiencing this cinematic gem! 🎥🌟"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thatgingerguy88,10,11 December 2006,"I had heard about The Godfather trilogy for years and years, been told to watch it, and just never took the time. I wish i would have. I finally got down to watching the series last night and it has become my favorite movie trilogy of all time now. Everything about this movie is impeccable. The acting by Brando and Pacino is magnificent, and the storyline never lets up, constantly keeping you engulfed in whats going on within the Corleone family. Pacino does a magnificent job in particular, as he is the cool, calm and level-headed son of the Don in the first film, and he makes a transition between this film and Godfather 2 into the ruthless cold-hearted mob boss."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rameyjack,10,19 March 2021,"I watched The Godfather and I thought to myself what a fantastic movie! People say it's boring but it's not it's a slow paced epic, and there are parts in it that keep you engaged and never bored. I think that the scene where Michael kills the men in the restaurant might be one of the greatest scenes ever created. The attention to detail is outstanding, for example when Sonny beats Carlo and end the beating with a kick to the head and then when Sonny is killed it ends with Sonny being kicked in the head as a slight foreshadowing. Excellent film and should be experienced by everyone."

If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."

Al Pacino and Marlon Brando played their roles perfectly and the plot is marvelous. It is a great representation of one world of mafia and underground. If you love movies you have to love it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),novocter,9,1 October 2002,"Great acting, great storytelling, and compelling images all add up to make The Godfather one of the best movies of all time.  From the opening frames to the final scene, one cannot help but be mesmerized with the intriguing and fascinating story of Don Vito and his family.  This is a picture of epic proprtions which features outstanding performances by veteran actors Brando, Caan, Duvall and Hayden; and equally spellbinding performances by relatively newcomers Pacino, Shire, and Keaton.  This is one of those rare movies where seeing it once, twice, or even three times is really not nearly enough to fully enjoy the greatness of this cinematic event.  This may not be the greatest movie ever made, but if it isn't, it certainly is one of the top five.  A definite must see!"

His youngest son Michael has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi. All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen, the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mharrison-17627,1,7 August 2021,"An overlong and slow film that may have seemed better 50 years ago, but is now boring and very dated. Marlon Brando's make up looks so fake and the obviously Jewish James Caan is badly miscast as an Italian-American. The restaurant meeting would never have happened in reality - Sollozzo tries to kill Vito, and then just a few days later Michael is just going to sit down and have dinner with him? Lol. In any case Sollozzo would have known the police captain had to remain on call 24 hours a day. McClusky would have given a false location, rather than the restaurant, to the police."

Michael Corleone: Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to a personal services contract with this big-band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. But the band leader wouldn't let him. Now, Johnny is my father's godson. So my father went to see this bandleader and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day, my father went back, only this time with Luca Brasi. Within an hour, he had a signed release for a certified check of $1000. Kay Adams: How did he do that? Michael Corleone: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay Adams: What was that? Michael Corleone: Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract....... Thats a true story.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nathanielman7,1,16 July 2008,"look i understand how many people love this film; good acting, pretty solid storyline, etc... but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward. i am a teenager, and while i do love guns, killing, and all that good ""teenage stuff"" that is in this movie, many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers. i feel that they are a thing of the past, and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest, and basically, don't love it as much as many people seem to. Having said this, i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather, not because of the mafia ties, but the struggles that the man character underwent; struggles that i can identify with. this was something ""The Godfather"" lacked."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ghanem-76421,10,9 November 2022,"This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions."

But then it took off and the plot got more and more interesting until some stuff happened and the main protagonist had to go to some foreign place. After that, it became a bore-fest filled with long drawn out scenes that added ""little to nothing"" to the plot. Like the guy's foreign wife... What was the Point of That!!? Fortunately, It ended in a pretty bad@$$ and brilliant manner. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie were pretty great. Still, that doesn't excuse the amount of filler and lack of character development for the characters that were actually important in the next film. That includes The protagonist too. (His Character Arc wasn't handled very efficiently. He was a lot better in the second movie.)"

These giants that act in this film made me great fan of 7th art. I simply can not find enough words to describe how much I love this movie, every scene in it. It deserves a place on this list, which is also to say and voices of other people.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dadynasty,10,13 March 2003,"The original Godfather changed movies forever. The major studios became less important due to its indie makers. I cannot say anything about this film that has not already been said. It is a masterpiece with only its second part and Citizen Kane able to compare to it. The acting, writing, and directing are some of the finest ever to be recorded. Al Pacino peaked in this film with his subtle, yet absolutely effective, portrayal of Michael. Marlon Brando delivers one of Hollywood's finest performances, with the raspy voice and arched eyebrows. James Caan also found his perfect character in the emotional Sonny. Francis Ford Coppola does the finest piece of directing I've ever seen, and Puzo and Coppola's writing presents the audience with memorable characters. Sterling Hayden also steals a scene or two as the police captain. A film that defies time and repeated viewings."

Also, the detail and importance of all characters who appear in the screen is superb, leaving no one without importance or purpose.

I didn't know how lucky I was before to miss this but now it is too late and I will never get those 3 hrs of my life back. The acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow, those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard. I suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012, but at least that had some ridiculous special effects, all this had was some really bad acting. The best parts were a couple of LOL moments during the shooting scenes, otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and I fell asleep at least 5 times."

Everything is going fine...except for the secret meeting held inside the house, a secret meeting on revenge. Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is discussing a problem with a close associate, while his mentor, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) stands on. The Don's three sons are outside celebrating the wedding: Sonny, the hot-tempered oldest brother; Fredo, the shy and quiet middle son; and Michael, the youngest son who has returned from fighting in World War II. Sonny and Fredo are in with the Don's council of 'whacking' people, but Michael refuses to be any part of it, due to total commitment to his girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). However, one day while shopping for food with Fredo, Don Corleone is shot by a betrayal, and is rushed to the hospital. The verdict: An assassination attempt. After hearing this, from Long Beach, California, Michael rushes back home to his father. After hearing about the ones who almost killed the Don, he plots revenge with Sonny and close associates. But a twist of fate happens to the family, and in the end, the once-reluctant Michael is made Don over the Corleones."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kezexofficial,10,20 February 2024,"""Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this epic crime saga revolves around the Corleone family, led by the iconic Don Vito Corleone. Marlon Brando delivers a mesmerizing performance as the patriarch, while Al Pacino shines as his reluctant successor, Michael Corleone. The film's intricate plot, rich character development, and powerful themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the consequences of power make it a timeless classic.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mferrari-44928,5,9 August 2023,"I really thought that this was very overrated. I thought it was very boring, and I feel like many movies now are better. I genuinely thought that I had clicked on the wrong movie or something because of how boring it was. I am only 16, so I think that maybe it is because of how old it is and that many movies now took inspiration from this or something. I guess at the time it came out it was amazing, even a decade or two after it came out it was probably amazing. But I just don't think it lives up to the hype. Not trying to offend anyone, but I actually began to fall asleep during it because of how boring it was. Overall opinion is that i think some young people might find the movie very boring because it lacks the immediate gratification of modern action-packed films, and its themes and cultural context might not resonate as strongly with younger viewers who are disconnected from the time period depicted. I don't know, just giving my honest opinion on it.... Boring, unentertaining, but I can see how it was ahead of its time 51 years ago when it came out."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),james_liebel,10,23 March 2016,"The best movie of all time. Story, script, scenery, sound, everything. The Godfather is sensational. The actors fits perfectly into their characters, it is a story that delights that captivates the viewers. The nearly 3 hours of movie appear to be few for beauty and motion that the film passes. Will be at the top of the best films of all time by several generations, The Godfather is a classic. Director Francis Ford Coppola has a work which was to be shown only in the best theaters of such grandeur that the film goes on! Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Abe Vigoda, Diane Keaton, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale ... and all the other characters and involved in the work. Congratulations!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chera_khalid,8,25 September 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that holds a special place in my heart, earning a solid 8/10 rating. The acting is nothing short of phenomenal, with Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone leaving an indelible mark. The film editing is expertly crafted, seamlessly weaving a sprawling narrative filled with power struggles and family dynamics. Its strength lies in its exploration of the blurred lines between morality and loyalty, making it a timeless classic. While some might find its runtime a weakness, I believe it only adds to the epic scale of the story. The music, particularly the haunting theme by Nino Rota, is both evocative and unforgettable. The cinematography captures the dark elegance of the mafia world with every frame. ""The Godfather"" is more than a film; it's a cinematic opera that has left an enduring legacy, and my love for it knows no bounds."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vovabajkov,10,19 January 2022,"When I saw a movie like ""The Godfather"" (1972), despite the fact that it is already quite old, but nevertheless it made a very impression on me. Moreover, I also read the book of the same name, and I had something to compare it with. Both are very good."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jennydavis131,9,4 May 2004,"The Godfather is the classic mob movie. The film is totally different from all the others in its genre. The way Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote this film so that the viewer actually sympathizes with the characters of the Italian mafia. Within the first scene the writers introduced all the main characters and all that's left to the film are twists, suspense, surprises and thrills."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mmelvin43326,10,11 August 2013,"The Godfather is arguably THE defining drama motion picture of the 20th century. The character presentation was magnificent. Though Al Pacino had other great movies prior to this, Brando obviously took a shine to him and really mentored this actor in ways I believe no one can imagine. Pacino evolved and solidified the role of the head of the family that I believe is still being used in references today. A strong but loving Father figure, ruthless and forceful at times, Pacino drew on his personal background greatly during this role."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ayham_tahaa,10,28 March 2016,"this film, is the best film I ever seen out of hundreds of movies. every other month I feel that I need to watch the first part or the second part of the series of the God father again and again. Which they are the best. even they were considered 70s but they still one of the best movies have ever produced and have been filmed to the humanity ! story of power and energy, family, reality of American History. also no one can ignore the music and themes of this films that takes to different world or different planet. the Italian accent also is adding a lot of art to the movie picture. with one word describing this film it is a story of dreams life !"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ilmwaan,6,2 October 2020,I dont really understand the thrill because my country doesnt have mafia things.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erfoj3691,4,11 August 2012,"There's no transition between Michael I (american hero, away of family business) and Michael II (Sicilian mobster). The shooting of Vito and the assassination of Sonny maybe explains a psychological turn to revenge (a little material showing the attachment between Michael and each of them would have been nice), but it's not enough for this transformation into a full-fledged mafia manager, interested in brothels and casinos. The character of Kay is pathetic, living among criminals and believing Michael's promises about changing his way of life. The whole movie is a collection of excuses to present sketches of violence."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),YerazankneriYerkir,10,15 January 2020,I love this movie. I can watch it over over again.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),s_jasinski24,10,9 December 2001,"I had never seen the godfather til a month ago the reason i saw this was because everyone who has seen it said it was a masterpiece. This you probably don't care but when i saw it they were right this was by far my favorite movie. If you like mafia movies, or liked the movie snatch you will love this movie. Even though it is 3 hours long it still seems like it's to short. There is nothing in this movie i hated and believe me it's an offer you can't resisce."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),danielgomez-69549,10,6 December 2022,"I was roughly twenty years away from even being conceived when The Godfather came out. Growing up as a film nut, I often heard of The Godfather as possessing a sort of mythic status that few films made after 1955 possess. I first watched it back close to ten years ago as a 12-year-old, never fully getting the story with the film falling into the ""great film that I didn't appreciate"" category until a month or so back when I got the Coppola restoration Blu-Ray and realized as an adult how fantastic of a film it truly was. The Godfather works so well because it isn't a film that kisses its ass on a variety of sub-levels. Francis Ford Coppola went out of his way not to make the film one that glorifies the Mafia in any way but still realized what a magnificent project it was. It begins in celebration and ends as the first part of the trilogy in bitter-sweet victory and tragedy for the Corleones with Michael having slowly morphed into a different character by the end and the Corleone family itself has endured tragedy after tragedy. Depending on if you're selective to certain genres of movies -- particularly crime and heist thrillers -- the 1970s were either a fantastic time with the New Hollywood group of directors or a pitiful time where the Anti-Hero was all the rage. I've always tried to keep a foot in both camps for the most part, but if a film like this doesn't make you at least sit there as the credits roll, musing in thought like Indiana Jones after being given a clue by a recently-killed shaman or anti-Nazi spy the first time you watch it, then I'm not sure you know how to appreciate films and movies as art and not just entertainment. There are so many ways this film just works so well; the first is that Coppola always had a way of making the cinematography and direction style look both extravagant, but also bleak at the same time, partially through sun-faded cinematography (I'm just guessing) and also partially through the way the film itself was shot. As well fact that Coppola spared nothing when it came to deploying talented screen stars of the day to cast The Godfather, leading Marlon Brando to find international success once more with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as the reluctant, but the eventual successor to his father Vito, Michael Corleone, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and of course, a pre-Rocky Talia Shire as Connie Corleone. These cast members in particular stand out in their performances and convey a sort of detached emotion that makes the film so great (if you need clarification on this, the scene where Vito overlooks his own son's body in the morgue is a prime example). Although it is the best install installment Godfather trilogy, the film itself suffers from a few key points that I've never been able to reason out why were included. Specifically, the whole sequence involves Johnny Fontaine and the Woltz horse fiasco which has no real involvement in the over-arcing storyline. However, with how spectacular of a film it is, I'm not going to sit here and complain about it any further."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tylersoffiantino,10,9 August 2019,"I have watched all 3 parts of this series, all are amazing. I don't think i can watch any other movie(s) like that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chengyiting,9,31 March 2020,"Within three hours, the group portrait is complete, and the characters are evenly shaded, and there are no idle strokes. Many scenes can be called great. The environment, sound, lighting, and props are integrated. For example, when the hospital changes rooms, the editing is too good and busy. He never forgets the tears around the godfather 's eyes, which is suitable for movement; for example, the clip of baptism and killing is a thrilling one. The second generation of the godfather gradually sublimates and freezes in the intersection of joy and cold blood."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),redkiller021,10,11 March 2018,"One of the best movie in my list
Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kenrigua,7,9 April 2015,"America, 40s Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is respected and feared leader of one of the five Mafia families in New York. He has four children: Connie (Talia Shire), impulsive Sonny (James Caan), the pusillanimous Freddie (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino), who wants no business of his father. When Corleone, against the advice of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), refuses to intervene in the drug business, the head of another band ordered his assassination. Then begins a violent and bloody war between Mafia families. (PRO) The wedding sequence ... is a virtuoso moment of cinematic art: Coppola takes his large cast of actors on stage with such art that makes us fully enter the world of 'The Godfather'"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bobblueford,1,28 August 2018,"I hope they remake this movie maybe then that nonsense will stop, but then again once is enough. I swear people just claim it to be the greatest of all time because it's the COOL thing to do, most of them probably haven't even seen it. It's long (really, really long), boring and pointless. Marlo Brandon (Archie Bunker called him that) was a terrible actor."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Umar Mansoor Bajwa,8,24 August 2007,"Marlon Brando was a great actor, who could amply improve a given role by his own imagination and Method based on his raw, visceral and natural acting style. He could add many dimensions to a given character /role by his own charismatic personality, demeanor and voice. People will never forget Stanley Kowalski of ""A street Car Named Desire"", Napoleon Bonaparte of ""Desiree"" and Christian Fletcher of ""The Mutiny on the Bounty"". He was definitely a living legend of his time, a towering personality over other contemporary actors."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jsw0112,10,1 March 2011,"After experiencing the Godfather many years ago, I finally made my mind up that this might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Taking a humanistic viewpoint on an unbelievable and fictitious Italian family mob, The Corleone's, communicates to me how truly ""unAmerican"" this movie is. Seeing how Michael Corleone (aka Al Pacino's worst role) is experiencing inner dualism between morales and his family showed me how boring this movie really is. When I'm watching a good ""American"" film I want action, not character development! This movie was one big slumber-fest and there wasn't enough boobs!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nalingfx,10,19 November 2013,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),godfreecharlie,9,17 September 2018,What can you say? Coppola got every bit of realism and ability out of the whole cast. They turned themselves inside out. This 3 part saga is definitely in the top 20.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),niksb,10,15 February 2023,"This movie is rightfully regarded as one of the best ever made because of its epic grandeur while keeping the patience and intimacy typical of European art filmmaking. Although there are legitimate concerns about The Godfather's impact in maintaining stereotypes of Italian Americans, makers of movies, TV series, and video games continue to be influenced by it decades after its release. Our collective cultural memory includes Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper, the lavish set design, and the music by Nino Rota."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vlad_platon,10,23 June 2013,"Inspired by the novel by Mario Puzo, the film is a grand story of Don Vito Corleone, a Sicilian mobster, got the head of a major mafia networks in America. The film shows a very realistic view of the world where the word given less accessible and promises have a capital value and honor is the highest price. Unfortunately for him, when his life is in danger, his children can not stay away from danger, and they are trained in this highly risky game of battles between mafia clans in America. Respect, murder, money and, above all, power: these are the words that best define this film and its action. Probably the best movie ever. Marlon Brando's performance is magnificent, it's the perfect actor for the role. The storyline is as good, and the whole cast has done its job and actors including Duval, De Niro and Al Pacino. Not very often blends so well a movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),irishchook,10,1 March 2017,"Classic movie with classic actors in which it cannot be missed. A movie that I grew up with and your children and grandchildren will as well. Not many movies are made in this way. Some try to replicate, but it cannot be done. A timeless classic that does not go out of style. A movie that may not be for the whole family, but eventually will."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kuykemal,7,6 December 2023,"It wouldn't be possible not to watch a movie that is touted as a masterpiece that has attracted so much attention in the world, so that it starts about 10 times and ends with 10. I was the one who quit my movie in a minute, and then I didn't think there was anything wrong with me, but I started filming again last night with a calm head, and the movie is 15th. After a minute came the realization that you know I'm telling this because a lot of friends like me couldn't stand it and left, but I thought I should tell you in advance how many mistakes they made, my only criticism of the film is that it's very boring to enter directly into events without entering such a movie, presenting characters, but in the following minutes you can't even follow, subtly drawing you into the plot, involving you in costumes, and of course, with the quality of the actor, the drama thriller action romance, there's a lot that can be said about the film, drama thriller romance, costumes, and of course, it offers you a delicious movie, especially Marlon Brando the late officially blew, and then, of course, the great master al Pacino takes the reed in his hand and leaves the bomb on your lap for the continuation of the series, I strongly advise, be sure to watch it well..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wencer,2,7 January 2003,"The Godfather is an engaging and compelling story to say the least, but as a movie- so what?  Just because something makes for a great story or play doesn't mean it can automatically translate onto the big screen.  There has to be some point of making it into a movie, and quite frankly, The Godfather works just as effectively as a book.  The characters, the dialogue, the plot twists- yeah, they're all okay, but where are the shots, the angles, the editing techniques, the sound effects that make this into a number one film???  The conventions of film are all used pretty simply according to the Hollywood format- ie, make the camera invisible.  There are few scenes anywhere in The Godfather Trilogy that stand out in the history of cinema. If you want an entertaining movie, you will certainly like the Godfather. But you may just as well read the book (unless, like so many today, you haven't the time).  But if you want a film that stretches the genre or that will blow you away with an element OTHER than storyline and dialogue, you can do a lot better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),larryw-98942,10,7 June 2024,"I watched this again this year in 2024, the first time I saw this movie was 1973. I've seen it at least six times. I can't believe how wonderful this movie is. It is so great on so many levels. Brandois unbelievable, as the Godfather, and Michael Corleone, the succeeding Godfather is almost as wonderful. Sonny is amazing, and all the other support actors and actresses are. There are so many elements of this film that are wonderful, including all the references to Italian culture, mobster attitudes, and references to respect, revenge, violence, and remorse that will make this a movie that will be remembered forever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AlbertoFig88,10,30 May 2017,This film will and forever will be a masterpiece. The Godfather is filmmaking at its best and ahead of its time. This film broke the boundaries when it came to basic lighting and cinematography because it was one of the first films to not light their highest paying actor up to par. It is one of the greatest crime mob stories ever told.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ramialzanati,10,1 April 2018,"It's the one of the greatest movies ever , it deserves a 11 not 10 for there is no movie can compete with it"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),corbanspaghette,9,30 September 2019,"The Godfather earns its status as a landmark in cinema.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mustikaslot,10,23 April 2023,"The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),owen-watts,8,3 January 2023,"What needs to be said about Coppola & Puzo's sprawling crime epic? It redefined the language of cinema and permanently altered the pop culture landscape. It is what it is. Rewatching it for the first time as an adult though I found myself suddenly wrapped in these amazingly sharp layers of meaning about crime, the nature of society and the endless back-and-forth of violence and civility. Of course, this was already present, I'd just never seen it properly. I don't necessarily believe that it's dated terribly well, or that every single moment of it is perfectly constructed but that a film this highly lauded and well-trodden is still so gripping and intriguing is testament enough, surely?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JackGambler,10,28 August 2013,"For me, it was a difficult film for the first part, so I had to look twice is not that supposed to mean completely, especially the names of the supporting cast. I'm not used to this movie, so I guess you can. A very serious film, it is possible to know a lot of it, and have something to say, of course the family. I think the story is very well found out, it can be a very interesting book, and I think he is funny, because as I watched the film ends, it is based on a book. I definitely Starring Al Pacino came out to be the best, I just wanted to know, first, I think it is fantastic developed here, and the other part as well. Robert Duvall and the other who think it is perfectly formed. Marlon Brando did not work out so much, or so it seemed, but when I watched the second part, really missed it, so I liked it somewhat. The others were good, I think highly of the performances here were the best of the trilogy there. I liked the three parts is virtually the same, only one was slightly better acting performances, but otherwise the same hold good in the other two, do not even think worse. Each of the three great film, but it did not become my favorite, but I will admit that a great, thought-provoking film, and everyone must see at least once. All three films with me 10/9-es osztályzatú here of course is 5 * for they deserve. Those who have not seen, they recommend that you look at it, I'm glad I watched them starting to like more serious movies! ;)"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),halnexus,10,21 April 1999,"""The Godfather"" is one of the crossroads one must cross before proclaiming oneself a movie fan and a genuine movie buff.  Francis Ford Coppola's film is probably his most flawless, although it is NOT my favorite Coppola film (that honor belongs to the unmistakably problematic but highly visionary ""Apocalypse Now"").  Still, in the midst of a 90s cinema which seems to re-evalutate itself every five years or so with new computer-generated images and thusly cannot enjoy the same degree of timelessness of several earlier, better movies, ""The Godfather"" will undoubtedly hold its own as one of the most artistic endeavors in the relatively new medium of cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pchs0114,7,2 September 2023,"The film stands out not only for its meticulous storytelling but also for its artistic craftsmanship. The direction sets a high bar, enveloping viewers in a world that feels simultaneously real and heightened. Notable is a role that adds unexpected layers to a character who might otherwise have been reduced to genre clichés. Beyond being an engaging crime drama, the film probes deeper, exploring unsettling themes such as the corrupting impact of power and the moral compromises often made in the pursuit of success. Its multi-layered narrative and compelling characters make it more than just another mob story; it's a study in human complexities that has earned its place as a pivotal work in the annals of film."

Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando)."

I had held off from watching it until now, afraid that it wouldn't live up to it's 'greatest movie ever' title that almost everyone seems to place on it. Fortunately, I can say that I wasn't disappointed. While after one viewing I'm not sure if I would personally call it the greatest movie I've ever seen, I can understand why people would say that. It's a great movie all the way around.....the cast, the dialogue, the sound track is all top-notch. Everyone involved gave great performances from top to bottom. Watching how Al Pacino's character changes through the movie is amazing."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jcwjcw,1,10 September 2011,"People do not understand cinema. I see the movie The Fighter with top stars and sure it gets Oscars or The Godfather oh ya great movie. I just watched a movie called Rockaway (2007). A movie where the main actor is just a normal man. And, yes, he acts normal and looks normal. But the power that can come from a normal man explodes in this movie (Rockaway). The people who rate The Fighter or the Godfather with high ratings or liked it any are people with a low IQ. They probably like these types of movies because cuz they like crime, like the Godfather. The godfather is trash. This little dude in (Rockaway 2007) this movie mostly uses intelligence to take down the mob and its godfather. I cannot stand the movie the godfather because America is praising crime and gangsters. This movie shows how one mans determination to stop a gang of thugs is expelled mostly with intelligence training determination and more. I cannot stand the Oscar and academy award panel- they do not know how to judge films. I will sing to everything good when the day comes and people stop admiring trash like The Fighter and The Godfather. I get a kick out of the movie Rockaway because the character can be a good role model. He is not a criminal, drug addict, and he isn't stupid. When we watch The Fighter, or The Godfather, you see top American actors committing crime, drugs, and utter stupidity. But in Rockaway, a regular American, or hispanic, not sure, man comes back to town to take down the entire Russian mob. He even takes down the Godfather of the mob while he is blind, after his eyes were taken out. I am thankful that I am not stupid enough to be excited when the bad guys (mobsters) win. I am the type of guy that likes to go to work without the mafia trying to get in my way. Mobs and gangsters and their movies just don't excite me, but seeing this high rating, helps me to understand why there is so much crime in America and why most people are too scared to go outside haha."

Its like the family guy joke, i hate family guy but i have to agreee with peter girffin, this movie insists upon itself to such a degree whjere it becomes un watchable please, do yourself a favor and watch a different movie, here are some suggestions, 1. 12 angry men, Avengers age of ultron, Five nights at freddy's and Big with tom hanks."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),torquatovinicius,10,6 December 2014,"The Godfather it is an adaptation of Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, taking as its main theme the Mafia Italian. The story portrays the ""family"" of mobsters Italo-American in the city of New York, known for Corleone surname, being Vito Andolini Corleone (Marlon Brando) their patriarch and the head of the family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mialaduke,9,18 January 2012,"The Godfather (1972) is an intricate yet compelling story about the Corleone family who is involved with the Italian mafia in New York in the 1940's. This movie shows the revenge, greed, and betrayal, between the Corleones and the mafia. Marlon Brando does a superb job playing the godfather who is the leader of the mafia, or Vito as they call him. His character gives one insight to what the mafia really is about and the business deals among them. Other actors such as Al Pacino and James Caan also portray their characters Michael and Sonny as the sons of the godfather very well too. Michael at the beginning of the movie has no interest in being involved in the mafia and by the end he has taken over the family business. People get to see first hand the transformation of these characters from beginning to the end of the movie. The story line makes this movie much more fascinating yet harder to follow than your average movie. Each scene that takes place in the movie is essential to understanding and delving in even deeper into the history of the Corleones and their involvement with the mafia. The great acting, excellent dialogue, and an ever-changing plot is what sets this movie apart from the rest. I recommend this movie to any movie fanatic. The Godfather is more aimed towards older teens and adults because of the complicated storyline and the violence shown."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),calebnhaight,7,29 February 2016,"It is very difficult as a young person to evaluate a movie which is older than I am, but this movie is still very enjoyable despite the poor quality which comes along with 1970s movie making. I expected a lot of this movie because of its reputation, so I was a little bit disappointed but it kept me engaged from start to finish so I was still quite happy after watching it. This movie is so unpredictable it felt like I was behind the plot from the beginning, but I enjoy a movie that makes me think, but that might not satisfy everyone. The development of characters didn't keep the leads separated enough in my mind. In fact, when Sunny and the Don were shot it took me a second before I knew for sure who had been shot. All in all, it is a very good movie that would certainly be improved upon in the modern day, but because of when it was made, it can't be compared to modern films. I think this movie will appeal to most people who enjoy a deep, complex, multi-faceted plot."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sourapple,1,10 May 2002,"I am a teenager, and i never thought of finding The Godfather so interesting!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),justinurbas,10,23 March 2017,"With several million hardcover and paperback books acting as trailers, Paramount's film version of Mario Puzo's sprawling gangland novel, ""The Godfather,"" has a large pre-sold audience. This will bolster the potential for the film which has an outstanding performance by Al Pacino and a strong characterization by Marlon Brando in title role. It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as to be superior screen drama. This should not mar Paramount's b.o. expectations in any measure, though some filmgoers may be disappointed."

We can not only catch a glimpse ofthe life of the gangsters through this movie, but can know the principle that wehave to accept something we dislike, forthe duty, or someone we love.In the really life, we may have to accept something sometime, like the Michael.Maybe we may feel unhappy or angry. Butin a people's life, it's always the situationlike that, and we have to experience them."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),donkirov,9,19 January 2022,"After so many years of knowing this movie only by hearsay, I finally watched it in full on a Korean Air flight. 18-year-olds are only allowed to watch it accompanied by a responsible adult. What do I think about the film itself? Well, it's interesting to watch all the scenes leading to certain murders, and male actors certainly put their heart and soul into the roles, although there is little chance that actresses will develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing that Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have roles in two sequels makes me think I'll get to know their characters better later. I also read on Wikipedia about restoring deleted scenes when three films from this series were combined for TV and DVD/VHS, so maybe this too could be an offer I can't refuse. In short, The Godfather was a very good movie, although I wouldn't call it one of the greatest movies of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ryananthony,10,20 December 2002,"I have only seen THE GODFATHER twice but is already one of my favorite films ever. Some of the ideas in this film are very, very creative. Espcially the part where Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) goes to the Italian resturaunt to kill the two men, but he knows they will search him. So he gets one of his friends to hide one in a bathroom stall. Isn't that brilliant. The performances are excellent. James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino. All great. What I don't get is why Marlon Brando agreed to portray in this film, but claimed his one of the worst experiences of his life. I think they could have chose someone a bit better for the role of Vito Corleone. Other than that, this movie is awesome. Everyone should see this. 175 minutes of family, action, drama, and murder. Why else would it be the #1 film on the Top 250 Films of All Time list."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),megsaha,10,27 November 2016,"This film is excellent on terms of everything present in a beautiful film.Characterization,Narrative,Direction and Acting everything in this movie is perfect.It has aged pretty well as it has been 44 years since it's release and people still discuss about it. They quote lines from it.It is not just a gangster movie.It's about family,loyalty,betrayal,power and so much more.This film has a story which will seem relevant even after 100 years. Michael's transformation into Don Corleone is probably the best film about rise to power ever put on camera.Above all the movie is served by some powerhouse performances : Al Pacino,Marlon Brando,James Caan and Robert Duvall.Basically this film has all things a classic needs to be a GOAT(greatest of all time)."

It is the most intelligently and brilliantly woven piece of work that any man in the film industry has ever created.  The genius of 'Coppola of the 70s' and the brilliance of the man are in perfect display here.  Words escape me to describe this movie. Starting from the foundations of one of the greatest novels (kudos to Signor Puzo) it gains tremendous strength from the greatest acting, directing, producing and scriptwriting that one can come across."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cahlikcrush,8,23 January 2022,"What can be written that has not been written already. The Godfather is the classic, genre-defining Mafia movie in which Marlon Brando plays the titular character facing grave threats from rival families. Unsurprisingly, there's constant violence. Characters are shot and killed, often at close range in graphic scenes. Characters are strangled to death and die in car explosions. Domestic abuse is shown: A man beats his wife with a belt. In one of many iconic scenes, a movie executive wakes up covered in blood, with a decapitated horse's head in his bed. In the opening scene, a man asks Don Corleone for vengeance after two men raped and beat his daughter. The movie also has cigarette smoking, wine drinking, and brief nudity (female breasts), and characters are shown having sex, clothed but audible. There are some references made to the sexual behaviors of Sonny and Fredo. In short,this movie is an opera without the music."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hnnooi-826-368075,10,25 October 2013,"This is considered my favorite movie and to many others, no wonder why The Godfather was considered to be the Perfect movie, cause of Frances Ford Coppola's Unquestionable direction and the film's story of the family business and a human story as well! This is the holy grail of gangster films that is to me and everyone, a real unforgettable classic! Excellent movie, quality acting, screenplay,depth of characters, locations! Producer,director,music,all excellent. It will be a long time before this movie is exceeded in all these facets. Current films do not come close in matching Francis Ford Cappola's masterpiece. Mr.Cappola's refusal make another film only reflects great decision making in the industry. Many film makers in the future should emulate the overall quality shown in ""The Godfather""."

The film also have a incredible production and keep the majority fidelity possible with the book just have little things missing and others not add.

As Vito Corleone takes the control of the Corleone family, you get to see incredible hard-taken decisions that will move the plot radically from a moment to another, leaving you constantly asking what's about to happen next and bringing an incredible sense of excitement to the entire experience.

He dealt in pretty much anything,from drug to robberies. He had some serious pull in the US government. Politicians eat out of his hand like birds.

The incredible acting and directing are all the best but it is the story that catches you and doesn't let go. The is a movie about family. Honestly is you replace Mafia with domestic violence, alcoholism, anything it would still work. I still to this day have to look over my shoulder whenever I eat an orange. I honestly think this will be one of the only movies that will never be remade due to the world exploding as a result. I love this movie and encourage all I meet to watch it again and again.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),banezechowski,10,30 December 2017,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zapan_2006,9,6 February 2023,"The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),quincyfancypants,10,12 February 2014,"I watched this for the first time when I was very young loved it then & still love it. to waste time i'll talk about love i had a girlfriend resonantly that i thought i loved but actually i just needed somebody at the time she talked about so many things i didn't really care about, at her ugly day i thought she was really ugly & to me those are two signs that tell you when you you love or don't love someone because like in the movie here was love and hate & so on, I know this because the son liked the girl when she was at her ugliest & cared about what she talked about....... Godfather puts an orange peel in his mouth at the end."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rgk-02042,7,9 August 2019,"Everything from the acting, directing, and writing of this movie is perfect. There isn't a single bad line of dialogue. There isn't a single poor shot in the movie. I could go on and on about it but this movie really is perfect. The story is classic and simple, leaving it easy and fun to follow. Every scene moves the plot forward to the next scene. There are so many great moments in the movie that're still studied by young filmmakers today. The only weak point of the movie is the character arc of Michael Corleone, while he is a well written character I feel like it's nothing we haven't seen before in a film. Overall there isn't a single thing wrong with the film and it's one of the best movies ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jonnymarks-27435,1,11 August 2022,"Goodfellow, bronx tail, casino, scarface, meanic to society, Boyz n the hood, fresh, and Donnie brosco are way better in my eyes. Honestly American gangster and legend is better than tgis movie. I will never understand why godfather is at the top of most these list. To me godfather, godfather 2, and the Irish man are the worst gangster movies. I've tried 8 times to watch this longest was hour boring. Please bring this movie down on list. Love every actor, director, others involved but just can't stand this series."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),asu_tbone,10,2 October 2000,"What makes this movie so good?  Just about everything.  Good acting, good direction, good story, good development...it's weird, but this is one of those cases where the sequel makes it better.  Godfather II is the best sequel ever made, and I just don't think you can really say anything about this movie until you've seen that one.  Really, you have to look at the first one as the rise of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and the second as his fall.  Despite the fact that he doesn't lose power, he loses almost everything else.  You don't really get much character development of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in this movie, because it's all being saved for the sequel (in the form of Robert De Niro).  The way that the two are intertwined is just absolutely brilliant. As a movie by itself, The Godfather is still a masterpiece.  One of the things that I think makes it so compelling is the blurring of the line between good and evil.  Just about everyone in this movie is a bad guy. But there are good bad guys and bad bad guys, and we're on the outside trying to decide which ones we want to root for.  We end up cheering on the Corleones, the focal point of the movie, but it's very reluctant as the climactic scene unfolds.  I found myself right there with Kay (Diane Keaton) at the end, torn between what I know to be right and what has to be done for survival. I cannot imagine this movie being any better.  It's fascinating, and the sequel does not do anything to diminish that sense of awe.  It's a timeless classic about the battle between good and evil.  But does evil really win out?  It's impossible to tell."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grigorynokhrinfuckimdb,10,3 September 2017,"My favorite film of all time, and the true ''Godfather'' of the gangster film genre. This film has it all; memorable characters and scenes, terrific acting all round (James Caan as Sonny Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael are among st the best acting performances I've seen) and a wonderful and gripping story line. And it's all beautifully filmed; the dark and smoky interiors of the Corleone's retreat (complete with Godfather sitting in the corner in his armchair, face shadowed), the family wedding, Michael's exile in Sicilly and of course the tense scenes at the hospital, and the famous restaurant scene, where Michael turns killer for the first time. Totally memorable, and no other film I've seen is quite as perfect, polished or stylish as the Godfather"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),VikingBurialService,9,22 November 2022,"Easily the best gangster movie I've ever seen. Basically, a young son's rise to power (or descent into evil, depending on the POV) as the leader of a mob family. It's hard to critique a movie like this, which is so highly regarded across the board. All the things you would expect to be phenomenal are; the score, the camerawork, the dialogue, the acting, the scenery, the plot, the pacing. Even though all these people in this movie are evil, murderous men, I still root for them as a viewer. And for some reason, this movie still isn't a 10/10 for me. I think it's something to do with the pacing; aside from Michael, Tom Hagen, and maybe Vito, it doesn't feel like we spend enough time with any characters. They're all so good that I want more of them on screen, but there are a lot of them, and it's a sprawling epic with a limited amount of time. That's a nitpicky critique (this is a fantastic film), but it's my only one."

It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BrandonDeMasi25,10,7 August 2016,"Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),seancolins,10,11 August 2001,"I am glad to see that it is still #1 on the IMBb.  I just watched ""The Godfather Saga: A Novel for Television"" on American Movie Classics.  It was great except it had to be edited for telivision.  I have just looked up that that theres a ""Godfather Trilogy 1901-1980"" which features ALL THREE films re-edited.  I shall sure want to see that some time.  If you have seen all three films you should surely try to catch the program I just saw on a movie or even network channel and see a very good deal of cut scenes, or better yet you should see the one I just looked up which I have not seen, but surely will."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),liammofo-816-651953,10,7 January 2011,"A very well known classic film. The story is what keeps me coming back to this. A mafia boss' son that has managed to stay separate from the family and their dealings, only to gradually be drawn back in as his father's life comes under threat. The transition of this early conflict of the main character is the main force behind this film. Pacino's performance is stand out as one of the best performances of all time. That would be good on its own but there's so much more to offer. All the characters are well fleshed out and Coppola's direction of slowly letting the story unravel whilst giving the actors time and space to portray their characters is genius. Highly recommended."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Loai20021,10,17 April 2023,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an iconic American crime film that has captivated audiences for decades since its release in 1972.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wmfdj,10,19 January 2022,"The film really catches with its plot, well-chosen actors and their game, atmosphere, dialogues.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),manavutopia,8,19 December 2018,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rachaelblakeegypt,7,29 February 2016,"The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn ""Godfather"", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed. Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/19122-the-godfather"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mgaboriault,2,22 March 2023,"I didn't really care for it, I didn't like it. I know everyone says it's so good, and yeah, Robert De Niro is in it (he's a fine actor) but I didn't like it. I couldn't get into it. It just insists upon itself. It takes forever getting in; you spend like six and a half hours just waiting, I can't get through, I've never even finished the movie. I've never seen the ending. I have tried on three separate occasions to get through it, and I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on the easy chairs and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's like they're speaking a different language. You know, that's where I lose interest in it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fifaworldcupkbuzz,10,15 September 2018,"This Movie nice. its open under world man life. ""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hotnoodletuna,10,5 March 2002,"This is the second best film ever made.  Only ""The Godfather part 2"" is better.

In the tradition of the greek tragedy, the superb story is crafted on a man trying to evade his fate. Al pacino and Marlon Brando give the performances of their lives, and james Caan executes perfectly as the hotheaded sonny. Props to Coppolla's vision and ingenuity, truly one of the great films of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nikhilchoudhery,9,3 August 2022,"This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),labirent-957-999342,6,25 March 2014,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone. The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[4]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[5] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[6] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[7] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."

Although the movie is great no matter what day and age you watch it. I don't think it will be a great idea to try to remake this movie . The old gangster movie is represented by Richard Conte and Sterling Hayden in bit parts. I would love to see another movie like this that is based out in Hollywood like this movie. If you read the book you would understand why there's so many books and movies and most movies don't stand toe and toe with the book but this one did. This is a old movie way before my time but the thrill and the envy of all the characters , family love it make you keep wanting to keep watching."

It is one those movies when no matter of the part of the movie characters stay the same - that makes it like One Big Pciture. It's the one you gonna watch over and over, repeating the best moments.The film's famous score was composed by Nino Rota. Francis Coppola's father Carmine Coppola contributed to the music performed in the film's wedding scene.[28] Later, his son would call on him to compose additional music for the score of The Godfather Part II (1974) and most of the score for The Godfather Part III (1990) Love this movie!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jrxkb,10,19 January 2022,"I watched the movie after reading the book a couple of times, so my viewing turned into another reading. Filmed very close to the text, and this once prevented me from enjoying the film itself to the fullest. I remember that as a child I took the book ""Seventeen Moments of Spring"" and compared it with the stems that they say in the film of the same name with Tikhonov. It turned out word for word and became uninteresting."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tonyum,10,28 August 2022,"Francis Ford Coppola is one of the most influential and beloved film directors of all time, from the fantastic stories his movies tell to the great characters he directs and shows on the screen. Many film enthusiasts, myself included, think highly of his works, even to this day, and while I would gladly love to talk about all he did right, I today gather you all around to talk about his magnum-opus, the 1972 crime film The Godfather, based on Mario Puzo´s 1969 novel of the same name."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nightofthereaper,10,27 August 2011,"In cinema, there are few films that can, at all, be considered either great, and fewer that can be considered perfect. Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of it's own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Let's get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, let's think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this film's score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous 'The Godfather Waltz', Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get it's award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched. Easily one of the greatest films ever made."

It's not romantic either and it won't change your mind on what you already thought about fruits. Yet it can still be a masterfully painted fruit bowl where al the fruits are beautifully portrayed by the artist the way they are. The Godfather is such a movie.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salmanbabar-62391,10,20 September 2019,"It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily."

After that I didn't forgive myself until I finally decided to rent it again. The second time around I made it to the end and I loved it. Of all the movies I've watched, I feel that this one has had the biggest impact on me. To me, being allowed to watch The Godfather is a gift. It's more than just watching a great movie: It's like observing a timeless piece of art by Leonardo Da Vinci. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jinfrank,4,21 January 2023,"One problem I have with the godfather it lacked tension cause I was pretty bored throughout the whole film. Nothing really going on in the movie that capture my attention maybe beside the one scene where Al pacino gf died in a car explosion. Im all for dialogue between characters if done right but this one I can't see to engaged by it due to director bad directing in the movie. The camerawork has big part of the movie being boring cause the director use the basic camera work back and back forth on the face when having the conversation between the character as opposed of thinking of new camera angel to get the audience engaged by the dialogue. The characters talking in the movie is like how someone talk in quiet place that has no energy and no personality which failed to engage when we watch it. If I want to watch that, I will listen to my parents in a conversation when we eating dinner which will be more entertaining. Also all characters have no personality, their just so egoistic an narcissistic that it's hard to root for them. The movie is just lifeless dull so I don't get why it's considered a masterpiece to cinema ."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacmelville,6,28 August 2008,"This is a good film. It is well directed and well acted. The story is engaging, and the sets flawlessly reflect the time period. And yet... it is only a *good* movie. I know that I will probably be hated for saying this, but ""The Godfather"" really doesn't seem like a masterpiece. Although it is certainly one of the most influential films of its time, I can't help but feel that it is a little overrated. Perhaps my tastes just aren't the same as everyone else's. And then again... maybe I am right, and a film doesn't have to be ""perfect"" to be memorable. ""The Godfather"" is worth watching... once... mainly because it has become such an integral part of our culture. It set the stage for epic crime dramas, and that alone is impressive. But... is it really so much better than other films? The first doesn't always have to be the best. ""The Godfather"" lays down a very solid foundation for future cinema, much as ""Gone With the WInd"" did, way back in the day (don't even get me started on that one). It is by no means perfect, but it is, like I said, worth watching."

When registering on IMDB a decade ago I rated it a 7/10 from memory. Incidentally part II I rated a little higher, an 8/10 due to the engaging flashbacks."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),glengolf,1,31 December 2020,"First saw this film back in Sydney in the early seventies. Had a certain kudos then as it was a groundbreaking film of its sort. Or so the story goes!
Watched it on BBC i player as there was nothing else at all in the film catalogue. Main observations after all these decades.
In the signature and most memorable moment in the whole 3 hours plus (snooze), I would love to know how the mafia goon managed to get the enormous horses head in the bed without the director in it waking up. Apologies if IMDb have already noted this ludicrous goof in the list of goofs. It was a completely lame scene if you will forgive the pun
Marlon Brando seems to be having trouble with vocal clarity and was slurring his way throughout the film. Maybe hitting the Sicilian wine a little hard?
All in all, including the mammoth length of the movie, no satisfactory end. Of course it was groundbreaking possibly for this reason and this reason alone. They were laying the foundation for a franchise of Godfathers. Something the film industry in the twentieth first century have taken to the max."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),britgrl,10,29 April 1999,"This is my favorite movie. This on the surface is a movie about the Mafia, but if you scratch the surface, you realize this is a movie about family and about the consequences of being loyal to your family. Michael in the beginning  is an all-American war hero, who is obviously not part of the family business. Michael transforms so subtly into a murderous, remorseless man, that you don't even notice it until the very end. Every actor is perfect, Brando gives the performance of his life. If you have not seen this movie(or even if you have), go rent it at the video store, make some pasta and spaghetti sauce, and enjoy!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),irishdancegirl96,10,27 July 2013,"I absolutely loved this movie. I watched it for the first time about a week ago and have not been able to stop thinking about it since. The acting of both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is simply phenomenal. Pacino's never-changing serious demeanor perfectly conveys the life of a mobster. One can almost feel bad for Brando's 'Vito Corleone'. He is displayed as an old man who loves his family and will do anything to make sure they thrive rather than a ruthless killing machine. There is violence, but it's not over-the-top gore. It's all done in good taste. I found this movie to be very interesting because I know next-to-nothing about the Mafia. True, this movie is long at almost 3 hours but it's worth it. Now, to mention the music. I thought the music was truly beautiful and timeless. It perfectly captures the essence of the movie. . I've had the theme song stuck in my head for days now. At times my heart was beating fast for the characters out of suspense. I cried when they cried. I really felt some of the deaths. Overall, I feel as though this movie rightly deserves the title of 'Greatest Movie Ever Made'. I could watch this movie over and over again without getting tired of it. It's a timeless classic and, currently, my favorite movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wereuat06-1,10,22 November 2006,"This movie had me speechless by the end. In this movies there are no errors,no mistakes, everything is perfection. It is perfect in every aspect of the movie. It boosted Pacino to stardom along with a Dog Day Afternoon. It is Francis Ford Copollas greatest classic alongside Apocalypse now. This movie has a great story line and shows what its really like to be in a mob family down to the very last detail. No part of this movie is wrong and the views of the mob are correctly viewed. This movie is an all-time classic. I would not consider it the greatest mobster movie as i feel Good Fellas is but it is perfect and could not have been done better by a perfect director. I give this movie an amazing 10 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wawewowe-dada,7,18 January 2020,"John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stevensonshelby,1,22 February 2019,I have nothing against this movie honestly... i could just never get into it long enough to stay awake.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jrez018,8,16 October 2006,"As what Marlon Brando says ""kiss my hand, call me your Godfather for justice...and friendship. This film is incredible, Francis's directing is justice to the film history. Marlon Brando is incredibly strong in his character. The blood is too graphic. The Score is beautifully mastered to the picture. God bless for ""The Godfather"" Especially, Al Pacino's acting is superb."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lucky_liu,10,3 June 2020,"Laying the foundation for the story, the translation takes a scriptwrit-like approach to presenting the story to the reader. The whole book is as steady and slow as an Italian opera."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pezhman-enayati,10,29 January 2022,The body language as well as the character of the godfather of the film are included and we see his beautiful acting. This film shows the prestige of a powerful person and at the same time Badright.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),piasa84047,10,3 July 2001,"Francis Ford Coppola achieved perfection on film with this great work. He directs so subtly that he makes it seem simple. But watch the subtleness of the scene outside the hospital when Michael (Al Pacino, at his best) lights the cigarette of Enzo the baker. One quick shot of Michael's hands, and they aren't shaking, and we know that he was born for the family business. The great Marlon Brando ad-libbed the films most important scene, that in the garden with his grandson, as the Don dies in peace, ironic for a man that lived such a violent life. The moody cinematography of Gordon Willis is the best ever caught on film. And the score by Nino Rota (I know the Academy didn't believe it belonged entirely to Rota, but who cares what the Academy thinks?) is a classic. The rest of the cast, which includes Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Alex Rocco, Richard Conte, John Marley and Sterling Hayden is in top form. Every film and television show about the mafia since this one has borrowed or outright stolen from this film. It is a story of profound depth, an American tragedy, told in three acts, and this, the first act, is the best. And yet at its root, it is a very simple story, as Don Corleone prepares his children for the lives they will have to live and the world they will have to live in. It can be summed up as family values, mafia style."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),roseharvard,10,16 November 2022,"The best cinematic version while being a thorough watcheye & never to be missed , that this piece of art is totally ethereal. It was 5 am in the morning and , I was going through my high and lows of paternal historical silence that made me feel like dwelling to search on something that can portrait god parents , whereby Godfather - title in itself was so ebullient. That's totally worth watching and indulgence of such masterpiece can't be left in spaces. Never too late for a bounded inspirational movies like where we can articulate our thoughts , feeling and in-facts morals too. The God Father is must watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MissDVD,10,2 December 2018,The best movie of all time! With the best actors! Top 10! Love it!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nathanrudd,9,3 July 2019,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dfsfe,10,12 September 2022,"Every now and then a film comes along that is something truly special. Within these films everything seems to come together so perfectly, ranging from the acting, to the writing, to the directing. The Godfather is one of those such films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vengeance20,5,5 June 2023,"I've heard much about this film, but haven't got around to watching until today."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ahmeedbakr,10,24 August 2022,The best classic movie ever.. To truly get the best affect of this movie you have to see it more than once. (I have only seen this once but I promise you I will see it again)
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alemciofficial,10,14 June 2023,"The Godfather is a technically instructive film with its dark and realistic atmosphere. The cinematographer of the movie, Gordon Willis, used shadows and contrast in such a way that you say this is the movie while watching it. While watching the dark and beautiful atmosphere, you also watch the plot. Mafia theme is a theme that I have loved before. The film chronicles the conflict between the Carlone family and Comma Solozzo over her drug business. Although ""The Godfather"" is a crime movie, it is actually a movie based on the father and son relationship. The best example for this is the scene where Don Vito and Michael are alone. It was a pretty good movie for me, but I can understand that it might not appeal to everyone. In this movie, your main focus is not on the life of the mafia, but on the fact that you cannot trust anyone but your family and you have no one but them. In the movie, we see that almost everyone has betrayed the father, except for his sons. That's what I meant when I said you can't trust anyone but your family. Watch The Godfather not as a mafia movie, but as a father and son movie, only then you will understand this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),safesidetacti,9,7 May 2024,"In the illustrious realm of cinema, ""The Godfather"" (1972) emerges as an enduring masterpiece that transcends time. Director Francis Ford Coppola orchestrates a mesmerizing journey into the clandestine world of organized crime, where the formidable Corleone family reigns supreme. Marlon Brando's magnetic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, alongside Al Pacino's nuanced depiction of Michael Corleone, immerses viewers in a realm of intrigue and power struggles. Through its intricate storytelling, immersive cinematography, and evocative score, ""The Godfather"" etches itself as a cinematic gem, leaving an indelible imprint on the collective consciousness of audiences and filmmakers alike."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),safenoe,8,17 June 2021,"Mario Puzo's book was gripping for sure, and so was this movie. Interestingly the word mafia is never used in The Godfather film, but maybe there was a reason for that I guess. The horse head scene is unforgettable that's for sure."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DomNovak,10,21 July 2019,"This movie is masterpiece of cinematography.
The story, characters, action and massage of this film is brilliant."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SweetManishaPatil,9,10 May 2020,The Godfather is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. I love the opening sequence. The drama and the crime is what really makes this movie phenomenal.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),borra_cuervo,10,12 December 2006,"This movie is a classic... You can watch it twenty times and still find it awesome. A young Al Pacino doing a great performance, the unforgettable Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, and my favorite character, Tom Hagen, beautifully played by Robert Duvall. The Godfather is a long film that doesn't get people tired... something pretty uncommon. The violence is very well portrayed in the assassinations scenes, I don't want to write any spoiler, so you will have to watch the movie to understand me... Also the music is extraordinary, musicians like Nino Rota are very hard to find. For those reasons and for lots of others, I totally recommend watching The Godfather... and also The Godfather II & III (I think they're not as great at the first part, but are really worth-watching)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),natalamaluha,10,19 January 2022,"I don't like crime movies, so I decided to watch it because it's a classic of the genre."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joselchong,7,10 November 2019,"Best classic movie ever, best narco, best Italian movie, best of the best"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bottisd,5,10 October 2019,"This film acurately depicted scenes from the book very well, and the acting is good. That said, not all books cross to film well. This is one such instance, in my opinion. Beyond the faithful recreations of some classic scenes, I don't see what there is to like. I'm sure some people say they just like it because it's popular."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),delhidevil-1,10,29 September 2005,"Oh my GOD. WOW. Amazing. These were the words that popped up into my mind just as the movie ended. Each word, each dialog, each expression on the faces of the characters, every single bit of the movie was PERFECTION. At one point, i was made to believe that I too was a part of the movie and a living-breathing character. I was so into it. Oh my god it was perfection. Marlon Brando's and Al Pacino's acting was nothing less than AWE-INSPIRING. The scene when Al Pacino shoots down 'Solozzo and McCluskey' was terrific. It just transformed Michael's character from a civilized American army-man into a civilized Sicilian-American don, and this journey of transformation was conducted so beautifully in the movie. Another great scene was when Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) expresses his grief to Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) his son over Michael's current profession. He tells Michael as to how he once hoped that Michael would be the one to give the family a taste of Legality, but ended up being the Don who would head the Crime Family of the Corleone's. How he hoped that one day Michael would become a Senator or a Priest. Every actor's performance was supreme. What a fantastic movie. Can't wait for it to be Re-released."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rudebuzztard,9,29 January 2003,"What can I possibly add to all the comments that have been given? I think the true greatness of this movie lies in the fact that Puzo and Coppola both worked on the script of these movies. Directors often get a book all wrong and screw up the translation from the book to the movie, and that's only logical, because a book is art and that's personal. THe movie would have been completely different if Coppola had written the screenplay on his own without Puzo telling him what the real essence of the story is. And that is what lifted this movie and the other godfathers beyond greatness... I give a 9 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),guscanepa,10,1 May 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, the movie was released in 1972 and has since become an iconic part of cinema history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MFC9,10,9 January 2022,"The Lebron of movies, (2nd only to MJ - Godfather Part II) the original Godfather still holds up, excelling in every area of film making. The support cast is A grade across the board, particularly Duvall and Caan. Brando created an icon, while Coppolla managed to assemble all the pieces to create a masterpiece. But it is Pacino who delivers the performance of a lifetime, only to better it two years later. The Sollozzo scene in the restaurant is an acting masterclass. 10/10."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bysalih1987,10,24 May 2015,This movie is one of the best ever made. Marlon Brando as its best beside -on the waterfront-. I've never seen a man playing a role like this. so realistic and authentic. He is for me the greatest actor of all time. a young Pacino or a Robert Duvall are terrific too. Family and Italian traditions are the main themes in this movie. even lessons about life you will in this movie. it shows the strength of a family.The American way of life.A dark history in the states are shown. The influence of criminal organizations to politics and the system are clear to see. you can put the whole movie plot to this time and it will still be effective . thats why the movie is so genius. A non true story film with true messages! strictly Art.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnmschofield,10,1 August 2009,"It is probably 7 or 8 years since I last saw this film but some films you never forget and this is a one of them. The subject matter is effectively an American family and the people who associate with them. Of course very few families are like the one that this film portrays. This film has a running time of nearly three hours and I have never met anyone who has had a negative comment to say about it. Anybody watching The Godfather for the first time may well have heard a certain amount of hype about it and in the case of this film the positive hype is all fully deserved. Like all great films you can look at it and say to yourself how could this film have been improved and in my opinion it could not have been improved. I had read the book first but this film brought the book to life in spectacular fashion. I have never been particularly interested in the numerous different elements in a film or all the politics surrounding it, I am more interested in the whole and this film does not disappoint on any level. Please watch this film at least once before you die you will not be disappointed."

One of the few movies that I find loses nothing in comparison to the book. Why can't they make more movies like this anymore? The acting is superb, the sets are great, the pace of the story is well set out, and the soundtrack is so right for the film."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),billy-jackson56,1,17 September 2010,"Brando was about the only semi decent thing in this (mainly because he was hardly in it, and i like Brando) overlong poorly edited piece of garbage. First things first the movie looks like crap Gordon Willis' Cinematograpthy is absolutely appalling, the editing is just bizarre it looks like it was made by a film maker trying to simulate tension or sadness and tragedy but had no ideas how to use the tools an experienced director would have used, the music made me want to smash my brains in and James Caan as an Italian American gangster was just ridiculous it would be like getting Danny glover to play Maculay Culkins character in home alone, but then again as someone who has seen a lot of the movies produced by Coppola like Peggy sue got married, tucker the man and his dream, the cotton club, Finnians rainbow, the rainmaker and many more poorly filmed dated badly written pieces of forgettable rubbish I should have expected the godfather to be as appalling as i found it, but as everyone who has ever seen the godfather who happens to be a film buff and not just a normal guy in the street who will watch the occasional movie they tend to drool over this muddy looking scrappy overlong bore fest. All in all I would say this movie should probably be destroyed so morons can't talk about how it is the holy grail of all movies ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),atashquliyeff_photographer,10,12 September 2021,"It's past 1 o'clock and I just finished Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather."" I should probably go to bed.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Nakhaly_Jabir,10,1 March 2016,"Simply the most deep drama i've ever witnessed, my favorite movie of all time, such a beautiful harmony, smooth narration, stunning music and especially outstanding acting by Marlon Brondo. Francis ford Coppola along with the score from Nino Rota delivered the most complete drama experience ever on the big screen.the transition of Mike from a man who defends Honor and law to the completely opposite, driven by the love of his family i watched the movie long time ago when i was very young so i couldn't understand his beauty, i re-watched it more than 2 times now and every time is the same effect, you keep thinking of the story and the act for the coming weeks, Godfather is undoubtedly a rare masterpiece."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lukeduggan2006-616-589046,10,4 July 2013,"""The Godfather"" exists within a vacuum: it is without precedent, and (not for the want of much effort), it is without imitation. To try and objectively review this Film, after its effect on my life, would be a poor joke. Frankly, I adore it. It is Romantic, absolutely. Beyond belief. Even Technically, it's a paradise. The colours drip, rich and heavy. The characters hold up a mirror to our psyche, and the dialogue has rightly cemented ""The Godfather"" as a movie which will always have a relevance. Ironically, this tale of counter-culture has become arguably the definitive Pop Culture statement. ""The Godfather"" IS the gap between Mainstream and Art. It is the scale to which every ""classic"" must compare itself, and inevitably fall short. Concise Coalescence: ""The Godfather"" is the greatest Movie ever made. But that's not why I LOVE it. Sure, I respect a whole bunch of Films. I can recognise a Film's influence, award it its dues, and move on. But I keep coming back to this, because I feel an affection for it. Every time I hear that sweeping Niño Rota score, I'm reminded: this changed my life! Days spent dreaming of my future as either a Mafioso or a Film-maker. To a degree, ""The Godfather's"" reputation does it a disservice; this isn't a Movie to admire, it's a Movie to FEEL. And I guarantee you, it's so powerful that only a truly emotionally dead person won't feel it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bball197,10,27 July 2000,"Being a young man I have not been blessed with being able to see The Godfather when it was originally released, and the thought of seeing this epic on the big screen makes me drool. The story is what drives this masterpiece, not special effects like todays so called epics. I was glued to the my television, watching this film. After you watch this film you find yourself whistling the main theme, and going around talking like Don Corleone. It is a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone tired of todays movies with no story."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kunaldhongade,9,26 December 2022,"The Godfather takes place in the late 1940s and follows the Corleone family, one of the most powerful crime families in New York City. As the head of the family, Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is a revered mafia boss who is well respected by his peers and feared by his enemies. When his son Michael (Pacino) returns from World War II, he is determined to take the family business in a different direction. He wants to break away from the criminal underworld and start a legitimate business, but his ambition and pride put him at odds with his father and his criminal associates."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),makisnkara,10,23 December 2019,Maybe the greatest movie ever. The first one is more special i think cause of Brando. Every time i see it i enjoy it the same!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),calspers,10,4 September 2019,A unparalleled statement in cinema on almost all fronts.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Andy C-2,10,11 April 2001,"In my opinion this is undoubtably one of the best and one my favourite films ever made. What is surprising as anything is that two years it was followed by Part II which is just as good (and then 20 years later and money-grabbing, dull and unnecessary third film). The first time I watched this film, I thought it was very good but overly long. But the second time I watched it, it didn't seem overly long at all, but beautifully detailed and concise - despite being nearly three hours long. I didn't find myself become bored, because the remarkable thing about this film is that almost every line, ever scene adds to the story or unfolding the characters, and their interaction with each other. The acting is believable, the direction is superb, and cinematography excellent."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jpchaudhari,9,11 March 2016,"Really it is a one of the awesome movie .super like Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dkurkan,10,23 May 2018,"We are all humans and most of us have a family and those who don't are likely to create their own kind-of-family environment around them. Family means love, devotion, sacrifice, and many other greatest things. Humans surely can't survive on its own and without even a family has even less chance than to stand out. 
What's a film? For me it's like a book with graphics which makes one person re-live the story with the characters as if he/she was there too. Coming from these two aspects; family & film, I think what movie could be better than a one which shows what family is and makes the one re-live the story of the film. We see a person, a father who would do everything to protect his family. Needless to say, all the actors who played were also the best actors of all time."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),haeslerjonas,10,15 November 2022,This is a piece of art. For me it is after The Shawshank Redemption the best movie of alltime. It's just incredible story telling. You never get bored and it's even in 2022 still just factual a good mafia movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are playing magnificent. The music in connection with the movie is just perfect. The whole part in Sicily is realistic and well done. I love that all the people speak italian there. The film is a brand new thing on his own. After the moral code is broken. The whole storyline his full of small side storys. Every side story is good on his own. I just watch this film again every year and it's never boring.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bassamalhalloul,8,9 October 2022,"The Godfather (1972)
Great movie.. The Godfather is wise, calm and inspiring. It's a movie worth watching and you will never get bored of it I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10 and it is well deserved."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tom Wood,10,25 May 2000,"A film better then anything Hollywood has ever produced. The critics adore Citizen Kane (a good film, undoubtably) but it doesn't have the deep qualities of the Godfather, it is a one man show (which can be good, Taxi Driver, but still...) but in the Godfather the star, Brando, I feel is a supporting character. Excellent as he is in the role, he still doesn't match the pace and glory of the next generation of Mafia hoods he is tutoring as the role of Don Corleone. The true gem of the bunch is obviously Pacino who controls the screen with a performance that he has never bettered in the 28 years since, but don't forget the arrogant Sonny (James Caan), the in control Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and my personal favorite, the runt of the litter Fredo, expertly executed by the late John Cazale."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Marcekas,10,23 January 2023,"The Godfather trilogy, and particularly its first two films, are iconic and ingratiated in the American cultural discussions of cinema and art so deeply that they're hard to parse from their legendary status. They're timeless epics that serve the viewer and the cinema-lover better as tall tales of kings, not as any introspective look at America or the 'immigrant experience.' From an artistic standpoint, their place in cinema is unquestioned in terms of its indelible effect on culture. One can gather that if the apex of Hollywood studio filmmaking in all its capitalist limitations, can be capped at using the visual tools of cinema at the service of a story, I can't think of many movies that do it better than The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bybadon,8,5 January 2023,"Few people do not know about the existence of this film. At least because of private mentions, references and parodies, almost everyone knows that there is such a film and about what it is about. However, if you read a brief description of the picture or do not watch the movie very carefully, you may get the impression that this is an ordinary film about bandits. So what makes this movie great? The answer is how it was filmed, staged and with what references to world culture."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jarbh,9,27 July 2015,"The world works differently in 1940's New York City, especially if you were a Sicilian. The Godfather, in all its twists and turns that coincide with the style of living in the mafia, sets itself aside from all other gangster/mob/mafia movies by providing a transformation unlike any other. This change, however, comes from an individual that you, as a watcher, wouldn't want it to come from, until you do. The hook is in the constant re-occurrence of the meaning of loyalty to an Italian."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),QuentisLentulusBatiatus,10,20 May 2021,"Everything in this movie is great the acting ,the directing, the script and this masterpiece every time you don't find a good movie to watch re-watch this film and feel the greatness of it."

The only thing that makes this a 6 for me is the phasing most Scene felt really dragged out. However I liked the movie and think people should see as long as you're not really inpatient. 6.8/10
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),j_swade,4,18 July 2004,"One of the jewels in the crown of the 70s cinema, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family. Itialian immigrants, caring people, and mafioso. From the first frame in which you see Marlon Brando's face lit from in front and above like a dark angel to the last frame of the last film in which Al Pacino's wineglass falls out of his hand as he slumps, the family gone and destroyed.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),christoph-73,10,11 September 2007,I have always loved mafia movies like Goodfellas but The Godfather trilogy is just so much better. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Swapneel,10,10 April 2005,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialog is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy about it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ADOZER200,10,29 September 2004,"I loved this movie. I always used to think it was over-hyped but i finally watched the entire movie in whole not too long ago and i totally see why everyone has been raving about it for years. I also watched other mafia movies such as Scarface, Goodfellas, and Casino and none of them even compared to the great godfather. I honestly cannot say who does better in this movie Brando's character is one for the ages, Pacino is so convincing it gives me chills, Cahn's character is played so well you cant even explain why you like the guy so much, and Duvall is magnificent as the cool under fire lawyer. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out...i know i was."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Eric_Wen,10,5 March 2003,"Whenever i saw a list of the top 100 movies, ""The Godfather"" was always on top.  I had no clue why.  I heard it was really good so i felt i should see it.  So one evening, after all my homework was done, i sat down on the couch in front of the TV and surfed through the channels and i land upon a memo saying, ""The Godfather: Next at 8 pm""  So i decide to just watch maybe an hour or so of it and then go to sleep.  I stayed up the whole night watching it.  The acting in the movie was excellent and the cinematography was great. The characters were so believable that whenever i see a picture/movie of any character in the movie, the first thing that pops into my brain is their character name.  After watching the movie, i couldn't stop talking about it to all my friends.  Now i understand why its always on top of top 100 lists."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Black_Mage_X,10,16 September 2007,"I have seen it four times and have enjoyed it every single time. In fact if I could only watch three movies for the rest of my life, this would be it along with to Kill A Mockingbird and American Beauty."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emmanuel-simms,10,1 October 2017,This movie really broke the ice on mafia movies loved ever second of it. Power house cast cant stop watching. I hope to one day play in a classic like this and I'm sure I will. So many moments i couldn't move just had to sit eyes clued to TV. Epic movie. I can watch it a million times and not get tired.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mdshep-12139,10,9 November 2019,This is one of a kind. The acting is perfect. Al Pacino's character goes from a kind hearted man to a man with hardly any heart at all and I love it. The music is amazing sounding like something you would hear at Epcot in the Italy section. The only reason I rated this a 9 and not a 10 is because the beginning is a little slow but it starts moving faster and faster to where it becomes an compelling crime drama.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),plsj,10,9 July 2000,"This movie is the best mafia movie ever made, and quite possibly the best movie ever made. Marlon Brando was brilliant as was the rest of the cast. I recently saw Citizen Kane(which is a very good movie) but I would have to say that the Godfather is far superior. Overall 11/10 Absolutely Brillant Film!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Albertosantandrea,7,27 December 2018,I think this title is awesome cast and magistral directing. Amaizing production and wonderfull drama.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),natestubbe,1,25 April 2024,"Boring sooooo boring. It was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo extremely boring. I wanted to gouge my eyes out because it sucked so bad. I hope whoever made this movie slips and knocks some sense into himself that this movie could be used to torture people. The dude that plays the bad dude is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in my life. I hope that whoever was involved in this movie, meet up in one room and breathe so heavily while watching this movie that they lose all the auction in the room and it gets their head and they realize this movie is the worst movie to ever created and whoever created this movie and all the actors that worked on it again never again ."

Well, a very good movie - but not ""that good""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carranzamontalvoalvaromiguel,10,21 May 2018,"Excepcional and Look Gansters Extremo Acción, y muy Espectacular de las Classic Películas de Suspenso y de Sangre de la Mafia Alcapone"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ibondifo,10,3 December 2017,"But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dylan-Potter,10,5 January 2014,"There have been many great films made. Alien, Life of Brian, Scarface. But only a select few don't bow down to this classic. There is a reason for this. It has a skilled production team. Acting-Some of the best acting I've ever seen. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the world's best two actors. Script-Well written, no weak lines. Score-haunting and desperate, fits the tone of the film. I could go on and on. This film is an absolute classic. Do yourself a favour and watch. Even if you don't like gangster films, this is an essential watch. Sorry if this review is short, but I don't see how endless words can portray how expert this is. Well made to an extent few films have reached or even beaten the level of. This has stood the test of time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),isidroguzman,10,25 October 2020,Overall the acting for everyone in this movie were really good tbh. would recomend this movie if yall havent watched it
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DainisKanopa,10,22 August 2021,This movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FilmLiquet,8,23 December 2018,"This criminal drama focuses on a powerful Italian-American mafia family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). After his daughter's wedding he refuses to make a deal with a new drug lord in the area, which leads to him getting shot by a rival family, who is now in a deal with the said drug lord. Following these events, the youngest son of the family (Al Pacino), leaves his civilian status and joins the Mafia, becoming involved in the ever-going family business, made of violence and betrayal."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ykassana,10,17 October 2002,"This movie is beyond words. It is motion picture history. I remember the first time i saw it. I was captivated by it's magical realism. I was swept away. What i saw was poetry in motion. At that moment i knew there will never be a movie as perfect as this. All movies should be compared to this. Artistically, technically and emotionally it is simply untouchable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aruslanzhabbarovkrut,7,19 January 2022,"Well, how else can you explain the fact that this creation is in 13th place in the TOP 250 films, and on IMDB in general in second place? Only the desire of people to conform to public opinion, to admire everything that many people admire, and thereby allegedly bring themselves closer to supposedly elitist art. This happens not only with movies, I note, but also with musical works. How often can you come across another 'Mozart - Requiem for a Dream' bullshit on some website, when in fact (I think you know this too) the author of this melody is Clint Mussel."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eskimosound,2,21 December 2018,"Great Acting dreadful editing.
It's one of those must see movies but its just over rated.
Watch the horse's head scene and see how badly edited it is...terrible seeing as everyone holds it in such high regard. Wobbly sound and out of focus cuts throughout. Coppola should be ashamed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wdst20,10,31 March 2007,"This film is very long but well worth watching. A story worth witnessing at least once. Thou fictional the Godfather is a film which captures the audiences imagination and will lead them into the verge of reality. As addictive as getting involved in conspiracy theories or the Da Vinci Code. This film could alter your life. Therefore to conclude. Againsts IMDb.com English only policy i say ""molto buon"". The Godfather is the first in a trilogy of films describing the life of Michael Corleone. Filled with an all star cast the films delivers on all aspects of filmography. Comedy, Romance, Action, Thriller etc. Admittably the comedy is limited by the ruthlessness of the Corleon families lust for power. The trilogy of films confirm that wealthy people can get away with murder, literally. Most touching about the film is the Italian mafia's resilience to touch drugs. In an effort to prevent any spoiler notes i'll try to end this comment hoping it is longer than 10 lines. A stupid rule set by the powers that be."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ntenorio2345,10,8 February 2018,Great movie from beginning to end. Best in the trilogy. Great cast. Two thumbs up. 10 stars.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mocan_korea,10,7 May 2022,I love this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),x_manicure_x,8,14 August 2021,"Besides being one of the first films to sympathize with the bad guys, ""The Godfather"" is not particularly mind-blowing or innovative. However, it's hands down one of the finest examples of a tastefully produced Hollywood blockbuster, one of those films that manage to meet the needs of all kinds of viewers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),General_Evil,10,26 July 2022,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."

There is no more quotable, or enjoyable film. Anywhere."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davefabs-28778,10,1 January 2020,The Godfather is the best movie of all time because it paved the way for cinema for decades and is incredible in its filmmaking craftsmanship.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),onlinesattamatkaa,9,4 June 2020,"I truly Like It!!
It is one of my favourite one!!
Beautifully scripted"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),goober2,10,21 April 2002,"I never grow tired of this motion picture, with its brilliant dialogue, its powerful characters, and its impeccable direction. This is one of the greatest films of all time, and will likely remain as such forever. Absolutely timeless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spencermcook,9,28 March 2024,"There are few films that require the level of attention that ""The Godfather"" does, which in turn urges to the viewer to set aside time to experience the film rather than stumble upon it. Though 1972 presents its own limitations with visual effects, transitions, and sound, Francis Ford Coppola's cohesive storytelling stands above everything else. The script is overwhelmingly rich and could have easily dulled the attention of the viewer, but because of Coppola's understanding and care for the source material this screenplay has endured over 50 years of new stories and revolutionary technology and has cemented itself among the rarities of film history. As animated an actor as Al Pacino is, he presents an incredibly calm demeanor with this character which is fitting for his particular arc among a cast as dominant and erratic as they may seem. By pulling off the bulldog look that he wanted with a dental mouthpiece, Marlon Brando's dialogue mashes up a bit but doesn't restrain him from expressing patience in his mannerisms to provoke an empathetic authority so unique and definitive to the power his character possesses. With a compilation of many near-perfect standalone sequences, the story weaves through an array of dense anxiety, charming interactions, and unpredictable outcomes. This film acts as a blueprint for countless films to follow, highlighting the vital balance between sharing a detailed story and including a range of characters worth investing in. The contrast of brutality and loyalty blend seamlessly together in one of Hollywood's most complicated and treasured accomplishments of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fsinayor-65232,9,26 December 2019,This is a classic. I recommend it for everyone. Watched this movie in school for one of my class and since have watched it multiple times
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lirikterjemahan,9,5 January 2020,"I like this film, old but gold I like this film, old but gold I like this film, old but gold"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emmanuelkatto,9,4 September 2023,"The cinematography and direction, needless to say, are incredible. There are moments where the camera direction could improve, but it isn't too distracting. The first scene, the wedding scene, practically is a showcase of how well done the actors' directions are. There are a lot of subtleties, the actors and actresses look so natural, they don't look tense at all, which helps make the scene feels more real. The color scheme also helps to give an ol' time vibe. An easy 9.6. Halfway through the movie, though, I started asking myself, ""Isn't the movie essentially over?"" The major conflicts are resolved, so what will I be spending another 80+ minutes for? And in a sense, I'd probably be better off stopping there. There are a lot of good moments, one of my favorite being when Vito finds out about his son's death. His grief is ironic, a jab to what he told John about crying. The scene on marital abuse portrays the misogynistic reality, still prevalent today. Connie's anger isn't a rational action, but an understandable byproduct of continual abuse (and a narcissistic relationship). But all these come with a bitter cost: less screentime on several supposedly important characters. Why do I even want to root for Apollonia if she's portrayed as a dumbhead with no relatable qualities? A lot of characters started becoming harder to root for. Worse off? The subtleties in the first half (e.g. Children playing in the street) lack so much variety they are practically reusable scenes. I know they're practically just supporting characters, but can we at least be more creative than putting the same laugh track over and over for doing random kid things? By the end of the movie I just have this bubbling rage for Kay and Mike's relationship. And I think a 9 would have been overly generous for its second half, so I'd gladly give it an 8.9/10 if possible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thomasjosephkirch,6,15 September 2015,"In my opinion, this could have been a little better than what it was. One scene that I believe could have been better in a sense, would be the scene where they could have done better was when they were in the house at the very start of the movie; where Peter Clemenza is talking to Don Corleone. The reason why I believe that this scene could have done better, was because the lighting may have worked in some instances such as trying to create an eerie lighting effect. Long story short, the lighting effects that a movie gives off has some sort of persuasive effect on the audience's feelings towards the film, in my eyes the lighting effect wasn't good enough to rate it higher than a six out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dougvanbenthuysen,1,30 May 2018,...I wish! What a terrible movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mitsubishiwarrior,10,4 April 2017,"The Godfather is 170 minutes of excruciating realism in the virtually intoxicating world of Italian Mafia - every detail is picked upon, every emotion is explored with fine resolution - it is a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abnadagouda,10,20 January 2024,"It's a action movie, must watch. The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jakepooch,10,12 October 2019,"Mario himself didn't realize he was writing the greatest movie of all time until he further inquired about being a movie writer and the first book he read stated ""go study godfather 1"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jameshetfieldms,10,3 February 2017,"In ""The Godfather,"" we have the New York-New Jersey world, ruled by five ""families,"" one of them headed by Brando. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Joshua-Pigatt,6,2 February 2014,"It insists upon itself. Love the actors however, Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duval and plus. I myself have not seen this film until my 20s, I am still a youngster and i have much to learn regarding what exactly makes a film a great film, weather it be actors, camera work, great writing. I didn't want to check it out because it has been said its been the one of the greatest gangster films of all time. Thought it was just a film the was blown up and given so much praise because its what it is, The Godfathers. I finally gave it a shot and, although great i did not care to view the sequels. Maybe i will one day, but for now I am not to thrilled to check them out."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sarinkrishna-71736,1,1 September 2021,"Bad movie In The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppla is either a bad director or a hypocrite. The audience cheers for the Corleones, despite all Coppola points to to try to prove he disapproves of the mafia. Can Al Pacino portray an ordinary American? Brando nearly sinks Part I with his Hey! Look at me! Performance. He was never an ensemble actor."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),movieguy81007,10,29 December 2006,"The Godfather is Francis Ford Coppola's best movie. This movie is a masterpiece. Marlon Brando is good in this and he won an Oscar for his performance. Al Pacino got nominated for an Oscar, James Caan got nominated for an Oscar and Robert Duvall got nominated for an Oscar. I liked the sets, the acting, the script, and the cinematography. This movie is better than Apocalypse Now. I think Francis Ford Coppola should have won an Oscar for Best Director. Least he won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay with Mario Puzo. I own the book The Godfather by Mario Puzo and I read some of it and it is good. This movie is one of the best movies ever made well maybe the exception of Pulp Fiction."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elboy79,10,2 April 2023,"Hello, I enjoyed this movie very much. This movie contained deep and shocking sequences and had the ability to keep me hooked until the end of the movie. I got to know the movie and I also enjoyed the computer game, and that game encouraged me to watch the original movie. I would have liked to see the character of the adopted father in the next series, but that was not the case, and it is not a problem; In this movie, cars and covers will take you to the space of hundreds of years ago; The adoptive father in the film has a decisive character with prestige, but at the same time, he shows himself to be humble and loving to children, and this case was interesting for me personally.

I have read the novel and that was really great too, Francis Ford Coppola was really good in editing from the book to the screen. The Acting and the Screenplay was amazing which are probably the most important thing in movies. Nino Rota's Musical score was awesome it fitted in so well with each scene and brought it the right feeling to it. The story moved from one emotion to another in such a perfect way, you will find Suspense and Passion Power and Hatred in a way that will change the way you watch movies.The Godfather Part II was as good as this one. There is no other Motion Picture that takes you in an unforgettable story of Crime, Love, Hate and Power like The Godfather."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gedizsoner,9,2 April 2024,"The Godfather is the best movie of all time. First of all, it is the best book adaptation ever made. In my opinion, the opening scene is the most successful opening scene in the history of cinema, and the character of Vito Corleone became a legend with this scene, in my opinion. Especially the improvisation and inclusion of the cat in the script at the last minute adds a completely different flavor to this exquisite film. This movie is actually a family drama, because the subject is Vito Corleone and the ""concept of family"" that he cares about more than anything else. The soundtrack is already one of the best movie soundtracks ever, with a quality that even surpasses the movie itself from time to time."

The acting by all the actors(Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, John Cazale & all the others)was just amazing. The level of detail the director went down to all the scenes was very very impressive and something that I'm yet to see in other movies. Both of the cinematography and the music score are perfect. We know nothing is perfect but this simply is just perfect. For example: The way the scene in the hospital was carried out was simply amazing. All the silence used in that scene really made things very tense for the viewers. From all the movies I've ever watched that scene has made me the most tense."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lisa7-934-700154,10,6 January 2011,"This movie is flawless. It would be quicker for me to discuss the negative factors about it as opposed to each great aspect, however this would result in a very short review as I have not been able to criticize one thing about this film. The storyline is superb as is the acting. Each main character is portrayed differently and has their own unique personality and as in reality, these characters change throughout the movie and the trilogy as a whole. In particular I believe that Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as the tragic character of Michael Carleone were the standout performances, but each actor and actress should gain respect and recognition for contributing to this work of art. The music in the film is absolutely stunning and is a perfect portrayal of love and respect. In turn, the music adds to the film's overall greatness. Most of the people who criticize this movie as boring to too lengthy and those who have not yet seen it. I can understand why this film has been listed as the best movie of all time. The movie is centred around organised crime but also features many other themes such as love, loss, power, respect, loyalty and trust. This movie is definitely worth viewing."

This movie is perfect in so many aspects that it is ridiculous to say anything other than what everyone is already saying.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nagasa-49255,10,5 June 2020,Among One of the best gangster movies And the characters are never forgotten by us
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ijosephpotter,9,6 April 2019,Really good. I liked it. beings a biy slow but it works.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carlos37andre,10,10 December 2017,"The first time I had seen ""The Goofather"" I thought that was just ""ok"" and ""good"", I think that my main issue was that the movie was ""too long"". Well, I passed the last 5 years thinking: ""Man, we saw that movie in the wrong way, this isn't possible"". And, yes, I was wrong, and yes, I had seen it wrong."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tedarrik,10,19 December 2022,"One of the best movies ever. If you haven't watched it, definitely watch it. I have never seen such a movie in my life. The actors are great, the story is very good. He dealt with the dirty order in the world. The lead is awesome! All the scenes impressed me a lot. I think this is the best of the whole series. The talented team and behind the scenes team did a really good job. I continue to recommend this movie to everyone around me. I watch it again and again in my spare time. He dealt with the dirty order in the world. The lead is awesome! All the scenes impressed me a lot. I think this is the best of the whole series."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tpngmediainfo,7,5 August 2023,One of the original gangster movies that can never be duplicated.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeje123,1,18 October 2018,Dude it's not that good. Just sayin. IMDB-users just have to watch more movies so that The Godfather stops being on the top of every film-list on this site.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),edmung,8,7 June 2020,Good story that border on realism. Can watch but a bit boring for those who wants more actions but again this is not an action movie. Enjoy!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),phoneon,10,1 April 2020,The Godfather is pretty much flawless and one of the greatest films ever made
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nurulislam-16140,8,18 May 2023,"Few films have managed to captivate audiences for generations, and Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is undeniably one of them. Released in 1972, this crime drama stands as a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with viewers, transcending time and leaving an indelible mark on cinema history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ismailalabrass,8,24 May 2020,"I wish to do the same Directing , its amazing in all way"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),microdjs,10,8 April 2016,"The film of the film, before the ephemeral production, technical marvel (the assembly that the godson of baptism, intersperses the prayer of Michael Corleone with the murders of which he is principal, the exceptional photography, which explores the shadow business of mafia and the light in Michael's relationship with Apollonia, pure and virginal), the force of the cast, the script that interweaves family intrigues with the struggle for power, and the perfection with which Coppola enacts its history. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are memorable, the first as the patriarch who does everything for the family, the second as the odd one who denies the Father and gradually gets involved by the mafia, even to realize that most of the time, the powerful is alone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),t-81966-84968,9,17 March 2020,"""The Godfather"" is a gangster capitalist society about the entire U.S. ground force systems dominate the control group the story of ups and downs in the story, is very vivid characterization."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jcarlos-96740,8,18 April 2020,"Watching a 3 hour long movie it's not a easy task unless you really enjoy the story and every single moment of it, but I really had to give this a try to find by myself if it really lives up to his hype.
Needless to say, the acting is by far the best thing in this movie especially Marlon Brando in his unforgettable Don Corleone role. The cinematography is very good too and the only critics I have is some flaws in shooting scenes were the gun is fired but the body doesn't get marked and some fighting scenes were they were literally punching the air but I would let that slip because they didn't had much of the technology that we have nowadays.
My biggest problem regarding this movie is pacing, like I've said in the beginning it's hard to watch a 3 hour long movie unless everything works perfectly and in this movie there were a lot of scenes way to bigger than the necessary, things that could be summoned in a shorter way and still with good cinematography were too long, and there are some unnecessary shots. The movie also advance years and it could've been done better, in a scene you are in the present and in the next you are some years later without no mention to how many time passed or even that the time passed you only understand that by the action, which if you aren't really concentrated will become confusing and It's hard to see a 3 hour long movie with long boring shots and confusing timeline.
The acting is the only top-notch thing here, everything else is just good."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),isaiethancomposer-92073,1,16 March 2021,This movie is not as good as it is made out to be and very long. Most of the scenes seem unnecessary and make the movie overly long and boring.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ijosephpotter,9,6 April 2019,Liked it a lot. being is a biy slow but it works i guess.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Chaselon,10,25 January 2017,"Widely viewed around the world as one of the best American films ever made, the opening movie from the crime saga The Godfather is a milestone of cinema history. The Godfather, together with Star Wars, from 1972 has become one of the most parodied movies ever. Director Francis Ford Coppola paints an amazing portrait of the Corleone clan's rise and near fall from power in the US as well as in Italy. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully manages to balance the story between the Corleone's family life and the vast crime business in which they are engaged.The story views the Mafia from the inside as Francis Ford Coppola saw it, and as Mario Puzo did when he originally wrote the book in which he portrayed the story presented here. This movie is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon, capicce."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vladimir-56-572523,10,14 February 2023,"It's a travesty that this movie hasn't picked up more Oscar awards. I mean, Al Pacino's nomination was for Best Supporting Actor... give me a break. Honestly, I don't see how this masterpiece din't take home at least 10 golden statuettes. It took so much guts and fight from Ruddy and Coppola to deliver what we see on screen. As filmmakers and cinema lovers, we are all indebted to the filmmakers, cast, and crew for pulling resources, putting up with threats of being fired, and ultimately giving it all for this movie to come together. I must have seen it 50 times in its 50 years since the release and it's a treat to my senses every time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dongarcez,10,16 September 2021,"Until now, still the best film ever. I can't understand why, but this is a real movie, with real emotions and story telling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),IsahilKashyap,10,4 June 2020,One of the best movie gangster movie. I am recommending this movie to everyone. If you are a die hard fan of gangster movies you will definitely going to love this.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JessicaPeatross,10,2 July 2020,"Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Don_Falone1985,10,6 January 2021,"What more can be said that already has on this utter masterpiece of a movie. Along with part 2, these are my favourite films of all time and I personally don't think there will ever be a movie that will surpass these stunning pieces of work. Let's start with part 1, The Godfather. An outstanding achievement in American cinema following Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, Francis F Coppola directs and achieved such a stunning piece of work, it's pretty much as close to perfection as a movie can get. It follows the story of an Italian American crime family, and is based on the real life Five families of New York City during this era, but is superbly paced and developed in such stunning fashion, you literally feel you are there with them in the screen. The character development is outstanding and we grow to love these characters like they are own family. The cinematography world class and still hasn't been beaten to this day. Who can ever forget the beautiful brown contrast colours that dominate when you are engrossed in this piece of art. The music without saying is up there amongst the finest piece in movie history. It's a film that still holds up, despite it being made nearly 50 years ago. It put actors like Al Pacino on the map to true stardom. If you haven't seen the Godfather then you clearly don't appreciate good movies. The greatest film of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),asoskovdaniil,9,19 January 2022,"What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word ""cinema"". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cal-brady,3,4 November 2012,"Here's how the arguments go for liking this movie go: The Godfather is a great movie because it's a hallmark of the genre. While gangster movies before this had been wall-to-wall violence and only loosely strung together by a plot, The Godfather was able to move away from that tradition by having a plot-heavy mobster movie. The performances were all superb and the characters all felt real."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kelinggojlag,10,7 January 2023,"This Amazing Movie A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),idukkifilms,9,13 September 2023,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) is a cinematic landmark, captivating with its tale of power, family, and crime. Marlon Brando's iconic Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael Corleone are legendary performances. The film's attention to detail immerses viewers in a bygone era, while Gordon Willis's cinematography sets a moody tone. Nino Rota's score is unforgettable. Coppola's direction weaves a rich narrative tapestry that's both deliberate and gripping. ""The Godfather"" is a timeless masterpiece that continues to influence and enthrall, defining cinematic excellence for generations."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Indy-42,10,31 July 1999,"I've always thought of the Godfather as a family film a king with 3 sons the eldest given his courage, the next his cool head and calmness and the youngest his wit and innocence. Except with this family film the family members are murderers and thieves."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shanila-69759,10,22 October 2022,"The film,, presents the story of a man during an American labor movement where labor was depicted to be too intricate and prosperous to care for the underprivileged. The labor movement portrayed in the movie is perceived to be extremely powerful, powerful to the extent that its interests are always met. The movie is set in the present day (1979) rural south with the protagonist Norma Rae, a Southern mill worker with two children. The film provides a significant evaluation of the radicalism that was portrayedby southern managers and how they learned to oppress the unprivileged when they were able to resist their legal rights."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alfredo_cazal,10,22 August 2022,And it hasn't aged a bit! I watch it and rewatch it and never get tired of it. Marlon Brando gave the most brilliant acting performance. Al Pacino is also unforgettable.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karlburns7,10,22 January 2023,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to stand the test of time.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),batuisel,10,12 March 2024,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is an enduring masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a cultural touchstone.

It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mssandlin,10,25 September 2002,"Mario Puzo's book The Godfather is one of the greatest works of fiction this country has ever produced, and Coppala brings it to the screen almost perfectly. Both the book and the film have been so popular, in my opinion, because they provide a stylistic and romantic view of power-a subject which we Americans have always struggled with. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ItsmeSaxenaBharat,9,25 April 2019,"Timeless! A masterpiece of cinematography, that encompasses almost all branches of human sentiment in real life situations.
This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wlosbo01,10,1 September 2005,"This movie without a doubt is the best mob movie ever made. It is well respected from all movie directors and inspired many actors/ filmmakers. The directing is wonderful, not to mention the acting is brilliant, cinematography perfect, and everything else about it. I personally believe that any writer/actor starting out in their careers should take the time to view the godfather and experience what a real movie is. The film itself is told in the most perfect way it could be showed. HANDS DOWN. The godfather is not in MY top 10 list of all time favorite movies, but I easily predict it to be in the top 5 best movies of all time in any poll put in front of me. 1. Citizen Cane, 2. Casablanca 3. the godfather 4. on the waterfront 5. schindlers list"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adhani-rachmi,9,15 April 2015,"Brilliant composition, between casts director and writer. Very intense and deep dialogue, most of them are quoted with so many people throughout time. Classic movie that everyone should watch. The characters gave their best performance in this movie, I'm fully concentrated in every minutes. Especially, Marlon Brando. This would be Marlon Brando's greatest performance as The Godfather, and I think no one could beat that unique accent of his. This makes him one of the most influential actors of all time. Although a little bigger role from Tom Hagen would be nice, just like in the novel. Definitely one of the greatest classic movies of all time!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ScamDilaer,8,7 September 2022,"One of the greatest films of all time, a true masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, as well as the film that established the standard."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),betweter,3,13 January 2004,"The Godfather is still a very enjoyable and strong film, even after more than 30 years. Something that we can't say about a lot of other mafia movies. There is one scene though I find not convincing enough and a bit clumsy, and that is the first scene with Johnny Fontane and the godfather at the beginning of the movie. Now, taking under consideration that Coppola was under a lot of stress during the shooting, because he was threatened to be replaced, the scene doesn't really work as it should in such a flawless masterpiece. Not only do I miss more insight in the relationship of those two men, the camerawork is lost for a minute and I feel it has been build up too much as a set-up for the Woltz scene, which is a mistake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),enesmazari-74577,10,27 August 2016,"When i watched Godfather for first time, i feel something in my heart. The whole movie is just a masterpiece.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dandre-Noire,10,16 June 2021,"This film beautifully captures all aspects of real life mobster activity, while also telling the story of one mans decent into darkness. It somehow allows you to feel the internal struggles of each individual on screen no matter which unspeakable action they had just commited. This movie has stood the tests of time and is the perfect precursor into the next film."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),edgeadams,10,26 January 2022,"The Godfather is one of those timeless movies that stands as a benchmark for how to craft a true epic that can stand the test of time. Boasting a colorful host of characters, amazing plot twists within its sprawling storyline and impressive cinematography, The Godfather is a classic and easily one of the best crime films ever released. While there are slower moments here and some of the editing feels a little dated, the sheer visceral shock to each individual death and the absorbing storyline are enough to overlook this in what's otherwise a magnificent film."

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is iconic, and the film's meticulous attention to detail, from the cinematography to the impeccable script, elevates it to legendary status.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elmansourjaafar,10,29 February 2024,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic triumph that captivates from start to finish. As a viewer, I was spellbound by the intricate plot, rich character development, and the magnetic performances of the cast. Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone is a big force, and Al Pacino's transformation as Michael is nothing short of brilliant. The film's impeccable storytelling, coupled with its evocative score, creates an immersive experience. The themes of power, family, and honor are explored with depth and nuance, making it a profoundly moving cinematic journey.

FOR ME not the best movie but not the worst."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),b22bandit,10,25 December 2000,"I am one of those dorks who knows virtually every line to this movie? Why? Because the characters move with that timeless, understated intensity that no other director gets quite right.  Coppola manages to give these brutal men a razor thin layer of humanity, and we're hooked along for the ride. We despise Tattaglia, Brazzini, Carlo-everyone who threatens the dynasty."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),barbiefreak518,10,3 January 2005,"You can't comment that the Godfather is a bad movie if you haven't seen all three. The ""first movie"" is actually the first part of a three movie story. It isn't three separate movies; it's three parts of one story. The third movie sums it all up. If you say you don't like the Godfather, watch the second and third parts and then comment. You cannot intelligently comment on a story that you haven't heard all of."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Corrtex,10,3 April 2023,"This movie is definitely one of the best movies in history. The movie has such a good story that the sequels that came after it could not dethrone it. There's nothing to say about the acting in the movie. Especially Marlon Brando. And Al Pacino, who was in this movie, then gives a very good performance. I can even say that Al Pacino's light shines with this movie. You have to give credit to the director Francis Ford Coppolan. His decisions made the movie as good as it is. Here's an interesting fact about the movie: During the filming of the movie, the mafia leaders of that time always sent men to the set to keep an eye on the set and to be aware of what was happening in the movie. In fact, the excited man in the movie who tried to read the congratulatory message to Don Vito Corleoneye from the paper was from that mafia. Since he forgot his lines out of excitement, they asked him to write them on paper and read them from there. The reason for the man's excitement is of course the great actor Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pumishmumi,9,16 December 2011,"The Godfather is one of maybe 3 or 4 of those 'perfect movies'. The ones where no matter how many times you watch it, you can't nit-pick anything wrong, unnecessary, even if your life depended on it. It has an amazing story, incredible (and subtle) acting, great cast overall, and it is consistently gripping for the 3-hour run time. There is no trace of any laziness or mistake."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),trminator-35198,8,17 January 2019,"This movie is MORE deserving of the spot held by Shawshank on this site as the best movie of all time. The film was rather concise, leaving the viewer with a desire for more. The main character, bizarre voice aside, was a character that is easy to get attached too, both in part to the well written script, and on point acting. A classic movie everyone should see. I am glad to have a movie in the top 5 that is an example of nearly unanimous support."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tourldecoodia,10,6 December 2022,"Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),baron-tockey,10,8 May 2010,"The Godfather. You just say that name and most people get a picture of Vito or Michael in their head. They can literally see the shady suits and the corrupt deals. This movie defined a generation, people who were kids when it came out wear the badge with honor. I, for one, was not blessed with that gift, but I did grow up with this movie. I convinced my parents to get this movie for me when I was about 12-years old. I sat down and watched it so intently, that for years if someone talked about a scene and didn't say the words just right, I could correct them and tell them down to about the minute where to find that scene in the movie. I would go to Jr. High and talk like I was Vito Corleone, and I'd recruit friends to be in my family. We became a tight bunch because of that fact, so basically, what I'm saying is, The Godfather is responsible for a lot of joy in my life. One of the top 10 greatest movies of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bignuts-06245,10,15 March 2021,"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall & James Caan star in this classic of Francis Ford Coppola's!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kujalatimo,5,26 November 2023,"I think this is one of those movies which are ""immune"" to any kind of critic but maybe that is why it's considered to be one of the greatest movies. No one can say otherwise. But I've seen better. It's not even the fact that it's old and there are some scenes that seem ridiculous since I watched it first time in 2023. Partly it was a good and beautiful movie but not even in the top 10 I've seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jay_HillP80,10,25 June 2022,This film was entertaining and leaves you on the edge of your seat. Marlo Brandon and a few others really outdid themselves in this film. Phenomenal all around. Amazing cast. Amazing camera work and lighting!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joseph96,10,8 December 1999,"Easily the finest cinematic experience ever.  I thought the book would be impossible to beat, but was wrong.  Thank you to MP, FFC and the great cast who made this the most awesome film experience imaginable.  Some things are better off forgotten and others stay with you.  The Godfather is a once in a lifetime event; acting understated, settings and plot flow superb. Sequels were good also, but the original can't be beat."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),like_cc,10,2 May 2020,"This epic movie, huge story structure, complicated character relationships, and many plot points all need to be established in the first act to lay a solid foundation for the subsequent narrative; pursue unlimited in this limited time Space, I think that as long as you can put all the relevant content into it without being bloated, it is already quite a realm; you can also comb in a paragraph in a clear and concise manner, which can only be done by the master's generous efforts."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anvimldpro,9,14 January 2023,"I recently watched The Godfather and it was an incredible movie. It had me captivated from the beginning to the end. The plot was intriguing, with plenty of suspense and unexpected twists. The acting was top notch, with Al Pacino giving a stellar performance as Don Corleone. The cinematography was beautiful, creating the perfect atmosphere for this classic gangster film. I was captivated by the acting and the way the film was shot. It was also very suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat. There were moments that had me laughing, crying and everything in between. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging and unforgettable experience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Trudi-7,10,9 October 1998,"Words are hard to find, to describe my love of this film. Every time I view this film I still find something to marvel at... something that I had missed on previous viewings. I too, believe that this is a flawless film. On one viewing,  I was struck by the use of lighting in the film, how contrasting the lighting was. The use of light and dark, so beautifully used throughout the film, to me, symbolised the light and dark of these characters, and the world in which they lived. I love the portrayals of Mario Puzo's characters... Marlon Brando was superb.I loved watching Michael Corleone change from a naive young war-hero to a ruthless mafia godfather. I loved each of the characters in this film. That is one of the things that I like best about this film... that these ruthless men worked their way into my heart, casting away any judgement I would usually hold against people who do the hideous crimes that these men saw as merely work and necessary protection for their beloved family. I love their self-righteousness and even their lack of conscience. I am passionate about this film ... every damn aspect of it!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Brennan_InterrogativeMan,10,21 June 2003,"The epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day one of America's most accomplished feature films. This movie is so good that it's not just a movie, it's a movie that has dominated and defined their creator in a way perhaps no other director can understand. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time."

At its inception, the narrative unfurls with a meticulous structure, drawing viewers into a world where family ties and criminal enterprises are indistinguishably intertwined. The Corleone family, led by the patriarch Vito Corleone, portrayed with a blend of ferocity and tenderness by Marlon Brando, encapsulates the dichotomy of brutal authority and deep familial love."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),belal3raby,9,6 August 2019,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fernandoschiavi,10,19 December 2020,"In the late 1960s, Francis Ford Coppola was at the beginning of his career when he managed to take over the audacious production of Paramount Pictures' The Godfather. The Godfather tells the first part of the Corleone family saga. Commanded by the respected Don Vito Corleone, the mafia family controls illegal business in New York in the 1940s and 1950s, in constant conflict with other groups. The adaptation was written by the author of the book Mario Puzzo Puzo together with Coppola."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mehrshadchakameh,10,23 May 2018,"Undoubtedly, it's a recurring masterpiece
There was no trilogy that each of them was great
But The godfather was, of course, an unrepeatable Trilogy"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davulture,10,27 June 2007,"The Godfather is considered a landmark achievement in film and considered by many as one of the greatest film of all time. The plot of the movie is a little hard to explain because the movie misleads the viewer and goes somewhere else but little by little the pieces add up together. The story begins with a bunch of people coming to the mafia Don, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for some requests because ""The Don can't refuse an offer to a Sicilian on the day of his daughters wedding."" At the wedding we are introduced the Corleone family which include Santino or Sonny Corleone (James Caan) the oldest of the family and the most hotheaded member, Fredo the second oldest who is a womanizer and isn't as smart as the other members of his family, then there is Michael played by Al Pacino who is a WWII veteran who comes to his sister's wedding with his girlfriend Kay and tells her how he doesn't want to become like the others in his family. Then is Tom Haygin (Robert Duvall) the non Italian character who was taken in by Vito Corleone as a son and become the consiliere (or head of legal affairs) and then there is of course Connie (The Don's Daughter) who is marrying a man named Carlo. The beginning of the story focuses on a famous singer Johnny Propane coming to Vito Corleone asking him for help to get cast in a film, soon Tom goes there and ends up ""forcefully"" making the Director accept Johnny Propane. From there things become a little difficult when Vito Corleone refuses to get in the business of narcotics with a heroin dealer named Virgil Sollozzo. After Vito's refusal he is shot and nearly killed when his shot down by Sollozzo's men. Without much hope Tom is taken hostage and tries to get hotheaded Sonny to take a deal with Sollozzo but when he refuses things become worse as a possibility of an all out war with the other 5 heads of family become visible. Then Michael takes his role in the story when he visits his father and realizes their isn't security before he is beaten by the corrupt Captain McCluskey. After the incident Michael offers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey who they realize are working together and in a climatic scene Michael takes out a loaded gun and kills both McCluskey and Sollozzo. Without any hope Michael is forced to move to Sicily to be safe guarded for a while. There he meets a girl named Apollonia and she is soon killed in a car bomb in a near assassination on Michael's life because of the crime's he's committed. Things start to fall apart as the Don finally returns home and Sonny goes on to beat Carlo after he beats on his sister Connie. However when Carlo beats Connie again, Sonny is aggravated and goes to beat up Carlo again before getting murdered at a toll booth by an army of gunmen. After the death of Sonny, Vito Corleone decides to go with the five heads of the mafia to make a truce, soon Michael returns now that it's safe and returns to Kay his girlfriend and tells her he wants to marry her. With Sonny dead, the Don almost retired and Fredo in Vegas (being incompetent to take care of family affairs). Michael soon reduces Tom's power and makes Carlo his right hand man when they move their operations to Nevada. When visiting Vegas, Michael goes to a casino which is financed by The Corleone's and run by Moe Greene where Michael tells Moe that he plans on buying him out much to his dismay. Later Michael returns back home where he talks with the Don and the Don tells him that an associate close to him will betray him and kill him. Soon after the Don plays with his grandson (Michael's son) he dies of a heart attack. During the funeral Michael discovers that Tessio was the traitor and soon has him along with Moe Greene and the heads of the mafia all wiped out during the baptism of Connie's child. Afterwards Michael goes to Carlo's house where he questions him on Sonny's murder before wiping him out. The movie ends with Connie angry at Michael for Carlo's death but Michael seems not to care and when Kay asks him if this is what he does for a living, Michael tells her he doesn't. However it's obvious she realizes that Michael is becoming more what he was afraid of."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anghockey-36275,10,12 October 2017,"Amazing movie worth watching, not just for entertainment, but for life less too. Each scene shines and brings reality to life.Every moment changes and at times you forget that you are watching a movie. I highly command this to anybody who loves acting,history or the mafia it's self too, it teaches to crap side of life, but with every coin you toss there are two sides to it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),arfansamsung,10,30 August 2022,"I watched this in 2022, because netflix beforely not buy the license. When i watch this movie at that moment i fall in love. This movie was crazy. This movie was made at 1970 but it still relevant for us in 2022. I love you don carleone. I hope film industry can make more beautifull film like this."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gav10000,10,28 November 2001,"This is the greatest film ever to be made. I haven't seen a film that I could even compare to this film. It made me smile, it made me thrilled, it made me shed a tear and it made me think. The Godfather is a movie about families. I do not believe Hollywood will ever come out with a movie of this caliber again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dina6,9,10 April 2024,A blueprint for tenacity in the making of the film. Love the story line. They say that Marlon Brando never memorizes his lines. He doesn't have a long drawn out monologue but wow he is the best. And Al Pacino killed it. I think the writer of The Godfather deserves so much credit for writing such an epic story but also a family story. Can we all relate to these characters? It some ways yes. We all have a Sal the screamer brutal one. The Michael that at first seems all pure and acts better than others in some ways becomes the head of the worst crime family. I also love Godfather 2 and Godfather 3.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),austinnashpark,10,28 June 2005,"I thought that The Godfather Part I was the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The amazing acting by Marlon Brando just blew me away. The story was so rich and probable. There was quite a bit of violence and adult themes, but these were essential to the realism and texture of the film. The thing that gave it it's brilliance was the acting, and the story. I most definitely agree with the place it is in on the IMDb top 250. Overall, i think this movie deserved a standing ovation. Marvelous. Outstanding. 10 out of 10. It was a superb film and I think that if you have not watched it, you must do so. This is a must see movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vmk-07674,10,24 May 2018,"I cannot anything that hasn't already been said about this movie. It is a perfect movie and something has just clicked about it that made it a masterpiece. The acting is like we are watching real life documentaties,the speed is thrilling,the plot engaging. The character,once you love them,stay part of you. Watching The Godfather is'nt just a good experience,it is joining the Corleone Family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),IPyaarCinema,10,30 June 2021,Review By Kamal K
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),parrot007,9,26 July 2023,"The Godfather is the second highest rated film on IMDb, and that says something about how widely appreciated it is. There is not much to say about it other than that it has exceptional performances throughout the entire cast and a very well supported script adapted from the novel. Its an incredibly immersive film, but it also takes some patience to watch all the way through. Part 1 and 2, which I think are both equally good and essentially one bigger story, take over 6 HOURS to watch. Its themes and setting are what is to be expected, and its also is true that The Godfather is an outstanding encapsulation of the era it takes place in too. When you have the time, you should go see for yourself how well it still holds up."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AnY10,10,28 May 2024,"Again, the best. There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mhizdhii,5,3 October 2018,"This movie is pure of violence, massacres, deaths, killings which I hoped that there is nothing like this anymore in our generation. I somehow like the movie for its showing the reality that we're in. Nevertheless, this is something thats not be shown to our children."

Something about the perfection of each performance along with the dialogue, I dunno...it's just perfect.  Coppola's (and Robert Evans') legacy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),smileamazon,10,25 November 2020,"I really love this movie!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mark.waltz,10,28 May 2024,"So many new stars established from this blockbuster, a few already familiar but not A list. Pacino, Caan, Keaton, Coppola, all having been in other films (or Coppola, directing), and along with top billed Brando, the perfect ensemble. Add Duvall to that list too, having been around for over a decade, yet now officially on the hot casting list. You don't need first names for these talented individuals. This film made them all legend."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elenasomerhalder,10,12 July 2020,This movie is absolutely worth watching. I loved everything about it. Godfather and his son Michael made this movie so cool.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),luluualfawaz,10,4 April 2021,It definitely defined a new cinematic way to see into the characters and their growth. It also created a new ground for mob movies. The cast was also a key element to the movie Coppola did an amazing job directing. Brando's way of portraying Vito Corleone was spot on. Same with al Pacino.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tkn2005lp,10,18 March 2005,"The Godfather is a movie that will never be forgotten. I watched it when I was 11, and I fell in love with it then."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elldbry772,10,16 April 2020,"What is it about someone you care about that sets them apart? Are they family, a friend, or someone you feel just needs help? What causes you to go the extra mile to put someone else ahead of yourself? You may find the answers in your religion, your upbringing, or in movies. For example, say your daughter goes out on a date with a guy and she is violently beaten by him and one of his friends. You go see her in the hospital and she cannot even weep because of the pain. So trying to keep your cool you press charges and try by the legal means to bring the young men to justice. It doesn't happen, their sentences are suspended. That may make you lose faith in the system that is supposed to protect you. So now you go to someone else who could help. This person is a bigshot, a pezzonovante in his own way but outside the system. You explain what happened and what you did, and all he says is 'why didn't you come to me first?' How many times in your life have some of us gone to others that don't care and asked for help instead of going to the ones that actually care. And the problem is solved. Imagine for another example that your father is in the hospital and men are coming to kill him. And you are the only one there that can help him. Imagine that you had your own dreams and your own goals that were different to what your father wanted. But in this moment you put all that aside to help your father survive. You assure him that everything will be ok and you are with him now. You bluff out the men trying to kill him and your father is saved. Most of us may never have to defend our dads from someone trying to kill him. But seeing someone laying helpless in a hospital bed in need of help we can all relate to. Every son, every daughter, every parent, every sibling, every friend. You see everybody wants to talk about the gangster mafia element of The Godfather, and say that is what it is all about. But family plays an even bigger role in the story by being the driving force behind the main characters. Family, love, loyalty, sacrifice all these elements are used in the movie to bring a standard boring mafia shootout movie to the level of greatest movie of all time. Francis Ford Coppola used as much he could to bring this point home. The wedding scene was not made up by any means but instead taken from other weddings witnessed by every Italian who has ever been to a wedding. Bringing envelopes filled with money to the bride, nieces dancing on the feet of uncle's, people waiting in line to see the father of the bride, sandwiches in white paper being tossed around. 'two gabagool, one proshootoh!' Then go to the kitchen to make spaghetti. Need a recipe? Try 'a little of oil then fry some garlic, throw in some tomatoes and tomato paste, fry it, make sure it does not stick, get it to boil, put in all your sausage and meatballs, add some wine and a little bit of sugar and that's the trick.' That recipe has been in Italian kitchens long before the cameras rolled. Need an idea for some quality time with the kids, well go to work do what you have to do and pick up some cannolis before you get home. Just remember to leave the gun and take the cannolis. Coppola always said he had to be good or no cannolis when his dad got home to share with the family. Coppola also put in his own family to work, his dad scored the movie, his sister Talia was Connie, and his daughter played the baby in the baptism scene. The family was on both sides of the family. But for me the movie revolves around Don Vito Corleone and Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo based the character of Don Corleone on his mother, everytime the Don opened his mouth all that came out was the passion of his mother, her wisdom, her ruthlessness, and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself. Therefore only the greatest actor of the day will do to play the part. Coppola agreed and suggested either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier was considered and it would have been interesting but he eventually passed on the role. Only two men wanted Brando, Coppola and Puzo. Brando had a history of being difficult and the studio executives nearly vetoed his casting. Coppola was able to make a deal with in order to cast Brando. Brando had to agree to do the movie for nothing, he had to put up a bond in order to cover cost overruns, and he had to do a screen test. They only got to the screen test because Brando transformed himself from a forty year old man into a sixty year old mafia don before their eyes in a matter of minutes. When the executives saw the footage they said 'no no no, WOW THAT'S INCREDIBLE!' Brando would be The Godfather. But Brando still needed a little extra help. If you watch the movie, everytime Don Corleone is speaking and stops and looks off in the distance he is reading from a card with his lines on it. He still won an oscar though. Two scenes are my favorite in the movie. One is the scene in the restaurant, I feel like I don't need to explain it, because it is the most famous scene. Just know that without that scene the movie would not have existed. When you shoot a movie, the scenes are viewed day by day by the studio decision makers. They were hating what they were seeing, everything shot before the restaurant scene was met with cruel criticism by everyone on the outside not working on the movie. All Coppola could do was show them this scene and the movie was not only saved but validated. There are moments in the movie that other scenes build to, the restaurant was one of those scenes. You know of it's importance because of everything that preceded it. The other scene is the meeting. Don Corleone stands before the other mafia dons and surrenders to them and their wishes. He reasons with them in order to come to a peaceful solution. But there is a catch: if you mess with my other son or if 'he's struck by a bolt of lightning. Then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room and that I do not forgive. So with that aside let me say that I swear, on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one that breaks the peace that we've made here today.' There is a time for peace and a time for reckoning. This scene is my favorite because you believe him, you go along with his plea for peace. But the other dons do not realize it is not a surrender but a tactical retreat.
So the movie went on to make a lot of money, win a bunch of awards, and won it's way on a bunch of lists that say it's great. I was lucky enough to not know that when I first saw the movie. I saw it for what it was: a father and three sons. One son was intense and savage, another was sweet and innocent, another was conviving and calculating, the father was all those combined. But the father was the steadying force in all their lives. That is why when they all find out he was shot they react in ways we all would react. When you see the father lying in the street his second son is there to help but can't, all he can do is cry and yell 'papa.' The first son nearly strong arms one of his father's closest associates because he wants someone to beat up. The third son panics and tries to do whatever he can to help. That is for the audience, and that that's how everyone relates. Finally, I'll quote Martin Sheen: 'The Godfather is the best filmmaking ever in the history of American cinema. There is nothing that speaks more to who we are, where we came from, what we stand for, and where we're gonna go. That's the work of a true genius.' I agree. It is my favorite, of what I've seen of course."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),guilledequerol,10,27 December 2019,"Godfather sets a new golden standard in American cinema thanks to superb storytelling and bigger-than-life characters, creating a near mythological tale about family, power and corruption."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eshlikozlova,10,19 January 2022,"An interesting combination of a film about destinies with a film of one story. ""The Godfather"", in fact, tells about an ordinary episode from the life of several influential families, from the position of one of them. In the established business and the influence divided between the Fathers, a new source of income appears - drug trafficking. It promises fantastic incomes and promises those who agree to do it, the possibility of sole power. However, this new business has a number of drawbacks: by making profits, it scares off politicians and the police, who will not be as easy to buy as in the case of gambling houses or alcohol. In addition, some heads of families are disgusted by the sale of deadly powder. ""It's a dirty business"" (c)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jefflittle19,10,21 June 2003,"The original Godfather is an epic that will live on in world cinema until the end of time. The only movies that come even close to its brilliance are Godfather II and The Usual Suspects. It is the most griping 3 hours of cinema you will ever watch. The acting is magnificent. Brando's whispering, hoarse voice is easily identifible to people even in the present day. Pacino gets started in his brilliant career with a memorable performance as Michael Corleone here. Even James Caan as the tempermental Sonny and Robert Duvall as the wannabe son are terrific. Francis Ford Coppola cemented his place in the Hollywood hall of fame with this epic that will never be forgotten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),giasutoancauvn,10,21 October 2022,"Author Mario Puzo made The Godfather a classic, when he wrote about the mafia but didn't talk much about drugs, blood and gambling, but focused on describing the plots, events of the family, how each member of the family improvising with difficulties. The temperament of the ""small tycoons"" is thereby also clearly depicted. In the midst of the storm, there are cowards who run away, there are people who turn their backs on betrayal, there are brute force who use violence to suppress and then die in an instant. After all, the people who seem weak at first end up doing great karma, and the smartest person to plan everything, is none other than the Godfather!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kareem-vfx,10,5 August 2023,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be."

This movie is the greatest film of all time.  As millions of people before me have said, anyone who has seen Goodfellas, Casino, or any other numerous well-made mob movies, this movie is the inspiration for those films, and if this movie had not been made, those films would not have existed.  In short, you can't call yourself a film buff if you have never seen this film, or maybe you can't call yourself a film buff if you don't own this film."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnrp-1,10,18 September 2002,"What makes this movie so great is that the characters seem to leap off the screen, often after only a few minutes. I've never quite figured it out, but it's as if you already know these guys, their habits, their mannerisms, their strengths and faults. Like Clemenza, a guy you hate to love - he'd just as easily kill you as he would pick a weed off his lawn, yet you can't help but respect him. Respect him? What am I saying? But that's the ticket with this movie, Clemenza, Pauli, Tom, Santino, Sal ... these people are so real, it's scary. Oddly enough, the only person who seems an ill fit is Michael, at the start that is. How can anyone so clean cut be related? But Pacino makes it work (unbelievable acting) and nothing is more engaging that watching the 'transformation' he goes through as he becomes the Don."

Based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name, The Godfather spans ten years and chronicles the history of the Corleone family under its patriarch, Vito Corleone, a respected Mafia don nicknamed the Godfather. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter drug business, a series of events are set in motion resulting in the assassination attempt on the Don and leading his youngest son to rise and take over his father's business."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sriramthestranger,8,19 July 2023,This movie stood the test of time for its unbelievable short impactful action scenes and the emotional drama between father and a son.

I often watch gentle movies, mafia-themed movies that make my emotions not good because too many 18+ scenes. However the reputation of the key set got me curious and I ended up looking at it. I have watched this movie many times and even bought books to read. I think the people around me should see it - An excellent work of world cinema. I give it a 9 because I don't like violent movies, that's all."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RJ-21,9,16 April 1999,"The Godfather is a good movie.  That's where it stops.  It is not a great movie in any way.  Marlon Brando gives the worst performance in the movie, being at best pedestrian in his role, and at worst immensely boring. (Laurence Olivier should have won the Oscar for Sleuth or Peter O'Toole for The Ruling Class) Mercifully, the supporting cast was excellent - Duvall and Pacino especially.  Caan was good as Santino, but suffered a bit in overacting his rages.  Part of the problem with this film is the book it came from - the book is about 450 pages long, and has a complete story for just about every character on screen.  Unless Coppola wanted a 10 hour movie, he just couldn't do that, which I understand.  I'd read the book shortly before seeing the film, and I have a lot more respect for the book. I would like to see Part Two, given that a lot of people say it is better (I can easily believe that).  I gave The Godfather 8/10, because, as I said, it is a good, but not great movie.  Truly great movies include Life is Beautiful, The Professional and A Clockwork Orange."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AndreaWeaver1,10,13 February 2022,"This film hits all the marks without resulting to cheap gore and over the top performances. One really does feel as if they are a part of the Corleone family. Coppola managed to take a concept as dark and dangerous as the mob and humanize it, creating a full-circle story that makes the viewer feel pain, joy, familial bonds, anger, justice and injustice, throughout. Paired with his incredible storytelling are the performances of everyone in the cast; so strong and believable. (Marlon Brando being my favorite) This film should be a part of everyone's repertoire. What more could I say about a film that has been glorified since its creation?"

Let him just sit there, a corner of that dark room, as if in the center of the black hole of the universe. People respect him, love him, and fear him. He is so complicated and so deep. Red blood and black in the dress are the most solemn tone in the film The Godfather. The Godfather tells us that as long as you can face this world decently, you can live decently. Therefore, he can casually interact with high-level political figures, from the lowest level to the highest level of society, he can also weave a large and intangible net. Therefore, whether it is a dispute over family interests or a trick of siblings, the godfather always seems to have the ability and spirit to control everything, isolated from all beings, overlooking the sky."

My favorite would be the Godfather himself, I absolutely love this film which is probably why I love Italian mobsters and the mafia so much, which is also why I love being able to play the bad guy. And also why I wanted to become a voice actor in the first place.

Don't get me wrong, The Godfather is an excellent piece of work, but I wouldn't go so far to say it is the best movie ever made. Personally, I like GoodFellas a little better. The Godfather has the best of all the qualities for a movie = great directing, great writing (not as good as the book), excellent acting (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DuVall), and all that jazz, but I still don't think it is the best movie ever made. One of the top 10 movies ever made (most likely), One of the top 5 movies ever made (maybe), the best movie ever made (I don't think so). If you like Mafia movies, this is the one that started them. If you are looking for the best Mafia movie or televison show, watch ""The Sopranos"" Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. If you haven't seen ""The Godfather"" yet, I would rent it immediatley!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nadaldu,10,11 October 2018,The Godfather is an cult movie for a lot of reasons :
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salesgab,10,18 May 2012,"Francis Ford Coppola's legendary masterpiece about the Corleone Family is a must to every moviegoer. Although everybody knows it is considered one of the best films of all time, only watching can one understand the true power of this picture. Coppola succeeded in humanizing the mafia, in a way that his main character, the ruthless Vito Corleone, became one of the most beloved icons in movie history. Under his belt, Coppola had one of the best casts ever to appear together on screen. In the main role is the legendary Marlon Brando in what is probably his best performance ever. Alongside him you see the brilliant Al Pacino in his first major role, the amazing Robert Duvall and the great James Caan. The supporting cast also counts on Diane Keaton, John Cazale and Talia Shire. Thus begin the best movie franchise of all time. Sit back and watch this powerful film."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Marty G,10,21 June 2000,"This movie is well deserved of its glittering reputation.  It simply blows its would-be contenders of the same genre (ie. Goodfellas, Casino etc.) out of the water.  It is perfect in every way, from the flawless acting to the stunning cinematography.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a Marlon Brando movie, an Al Pacino movie, a James Caan movie, a Robert Duval movie or a Diane Keaton movie where they turn out a better performance.  And I think that the credit for all of this has to go to the films director, Francis Ford Coppola.  And anyone who tries to tell you that this movie is anything less that the greatest single piece of cinema of all time simply does not know what they are talking about (although the Godfather part 2 comes extremely close...).  So I plead with you, please, please, please go out and rent (or even better, BUY!) this film, even if you have read the book (although if you have done that I suspect you will have seen the movie too!) because I guarantee you will fall in love with it."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brandinscottlindsey,9,18 June 2018,"The Godfather explores criminality, the temptations of wealth, loyalty, and what one is willing to do to protect those they love. There is a theme in the story of life and death, a duality of one thing ending and another beginning. While Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is a successful and capable character within a crime family, he only fills this role to protect those he loves. This film explores the ideas of the complicated villain. Justice, loyalty, and family are of ultimate importance, but there is a criminal twist to these ideals."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thomasgouldsbrough,9,14 March 2022,"When I first watched the Godfather, I thought it was long, and overrated. I really didn't understand what the hype was for, and why this film is so critically acclaimed, being #2 on IMDB's top 250 movies. It was only over time when I was reminded by it, such as the visual look of Don Vito Corleone, or the iconic quotes such as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", that I began to realise that I had witnessed a masterpiece. The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in history, that has truly influenced our society. There's good story telling, distinct memorable characters, and a very good ending. I don't believe that it's the 2nd greatest film of all time, I think films such as Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange and American Beauty are better, but it's certainly deserved a top 10 spot. Believe the hype."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yusufdenizakay,10,19 February 2016,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ally_A,10,27 December 2018,"This movie is the only movie I've seen it three times. It contains action, romance, trailer, scary and so on. Which can be suited to any taste. Perfect acting from Brando and Pacino, as well as Keaton, delights you."

The story that grows is simply one of the best that converts to cinema, the scenery, the era, the cast, all contribute to a stunning three part drama. Personally, Brando gives a master class in timing, delivery, to the extent we can all see, he is the boss, in this star studded film. I will leave you with this advice, please , watch it a few times, there are pieces of the film you will miss, it's only after reviewing it a few times will you pick up on the nuances that make this epic a stand out."

I was 10 and was completely stary eyed when I finished it for the first time. Being from a long line of Italians, the personal mannerism they use in thier day to day life is perfect and authentic.

First, it exhibited the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a wholly new mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Second, it re-established Brando's standing as a major player after years of being labeled ""box-office poison"". And third, it points to Brando's influence as ""godfather"" to a generation of actors, many which play his children in this film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jbirtel,10,5 June 2002,"Godfather and PART II are examples of elite filmmaking. Anyone seeing them for the first time should introduce themselves to the theatrical versions (Part III is good - the Vatican sequences are brilliant - but it's just not in the same league; many scenes were just recaps of what we saw [better] in I & II) ( PART II also recaps some scenes from the original, but they were presented on the ""flipside"" - and it worked)."

It has an excellent story with an excellent mafia atmosphere, and since I love the mafia theme, I fell in love with this film. It's unbelievable how well the film is made, and it's a 1972 film. The actor Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone, performed a perfect job, and the godfather himself is definitely worth mentioning. Overall, all the actors did an excellent performance here. There are a lot of legendary scenes. The scene in Italy is one of the best and maybe the best scene of all the movies ever. There is also a soundtrack, which is masterful and it is one of the best soundtracks ever. Also maybe the best ever. The Godfather is MASTERPIECE and it's a MUST-SEE movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aydinceltek,10,18 June 2019,"As the name of this masterpiece implies, Godfather is truly the Godfather of Mafia Film. Every cliche and idea that has been introduced into movies and TV shows based around the Mafia have elements that were first introduced in the Godfather and its sequels. And the Godfather's influence does not only lay in English speaking countries. For example, as someone of Turkish descent, I have noticed that many of Turkey's mafia-based TV shows are influenced by this masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oliver-ontanon,10,5 February 2024,"From the initial scene that represents joy (marriage of Vito's daughter) to Michael's death due to the death of his only daughter (innocent, unrelated to the world of the Mafia), the godfather represents cinema at its maximum splendor, he here my arguments.

At first Coppola chooses his cast perfectly, especially Michel (Al Pacino), a character with little experience and innocence in the world of the Mafia, Sonny, an impulsive man lacking reason, and Tom, a great lawyer and thinker, but always (redundancy ). ) focused on advocacy. This is where Michael stands out, as his cunning focuses on the street, on everyday life, on quickly reading his surroundings and in particular the sign that there is a conspiracy to murder his father, Vito. First talk of the first film, Santino thinks, Vito realizes that his son opened an important door for the enemy (Sollozzo) to take advantage of his weakness or perhaps enthusiasm, trying to overthrow Vito, through the natural and economic seduction of his son . Older, who at the time falters and interprets that he must take the reins. Later, Michael, in a flash of personality, performs one of the best sequences in cinema (spoiler); suggest the death of the police commander and Sollozzo himself. The only son who was never involved with the mafia suggests getting involved, the beginning of the best progress of the character, and likewise of one of the best actors in the history of cinema. With these short scenes that exemplify the magnificence of Godfather 1 (without even representing 30% of the saga), I take the argument as sufficient to explain what, for me, is the best movie and cinema saga that has existed, exists, and Maybe, in life, it will exist. I prefer not to dwell on these amazing details that explain life itself, and I give a rating of 10/10 for this film, which is the only one that in my life I have taken the time to, in my opinion, evaluate."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joker-scar,10,17 September 2018,"I am not going to get into extensive detail on how great this film is, hundreds if not thousands before me have already done so and to good credit. As a Hollywood director has once previously stated on another non-Godfather film commentary track, watching the film is a cinema class in of its self... if you are going to watch only one film in your life, it is this one. I must agree, I watch this film repeatedly, not only to be entertained but also to study as a filmmaker myself. 
Obviously the many directors who turned down the assignment to direct this adapted script had a strong moral objection to glorify the mafia, and I agree, there is absolutely ""nothing"" glamorous about real life gangsters in organized crime. But this is a fictional tale and Coppola used his own strong Italian American heritage to infuse the film with far greater themes and family bonding than any of the other directors originally approached would have done. He raised this film from the exploitative gangster flick that it was slotted to be by the studio, even wanting to change the novel's 1940's setting to modern day to save money on the budget, to that of Shakespearian levels and the best example of film art in Hollywood films. Coppola well deserved the Oscar, fame and the money that followed the film's release, in my opinion anyway.
Perhaps it is because I saw this film as a youngster and accepted the film as is, as many others I watched, good and cheesy, but watching it even now there doesn't seem to be a single bad shot or angle in the entire film, except one.... Diane Keaton's false ""double-take"" reaction to the exploded vehicle in the back ground when she is confronted by Tom as she returns to the Mall to see Michael. It always takes me out of the film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yusufovbrandon,10,10 February 2023,"I just watched The Godfather and I'm absolutely blown away. It's a classic that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),YellowManReanimated,10,17 August 2021,"It's among the most famous, celebrated, parodied and influential films ever made. Adapted from the book by Mario Puzo, this is a clear demonstration of the fact that film adaptations do not have to be the poor relation of the original novel. For the few who may not have seen it, the film is centred around two characters: firstly, there's Don Corleone, a man of power and influence who exists in the penumbra of crime and respectability. He is ruthless but also humane, powerful yet vulnerable, wise and simultaneously stubborn. He is charged with taking care of his ""family"", including blood relations and his wider organisation, which is built on the Sicilian model of organised crime. In order to maintain his position of influence in a shifting and complicated political landscape, he must be judicious in his decision-making, picking his battles as appropriate and channelling his resources as prudent. Then there is his youngest son: Michael Corleone. Initially he wishes to have no involvement in the family business; he wants to be a fully-fledged American and to let go of the murky ties to his Sicilian heritage and its connection with clandestine murder and violence. He serves in the army during WW2 and is decorated for his service. But, as his father starts to lose his grip on power and the Corleone family find themselves thrust into severe peril, the duty falls to him to step into the centre of events. He demonstrated his heroism for his country, now he must do the same for his family. The question is, at what cost to himself and the wholesome American life that he had been on the verge of building?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),askarifilmsllc,10,23 December 2022,"This film is nothing short of a masterpiece! The writing is amazing, and the directing is top notch. This film has inspired hundreds of filmmakers around the world. The Godfather has an outstanding cast and the script has impressive dialogue. This film is entertaining from start to finish. Francis Coppola's imagination & vision is laser sharp. I will always keep this film in my movie collection. A must have for every movie lover.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OsmanShahab,9,11 February 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a classic movie that will have you in stitches... from laughter! This film is a true testament to the comedic talents of Marlon Brando, who absolutely steals the show as the lovable gangster, Vito Corleone. From his over-the-top facial expressions to his hilarious one-liners, you won't be able to stop giggling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jfernand-1,10,8 April 2003,"As close to a perfect film as you're going to get.  The young, fairly new director(in 1972)Francis Ford Coppola did an outstanding job of getting A+ performances out of his 'entire' cast. When watching this masterpiece of American film, one does not even take notice that they are watching actors perform.  Instead, it's as if a hidden camera has captured the real lives of a post war New York mafia family.  This is by far my favorite film of all time and recomend it as a must see.  I envy the person who will have the thrill of seeing it for the first time.  It's quite awsome."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tejaspaleti-27553,10,10 April 2023,"This film is utterly brilliant in every possible way, from the character arcs to the dramatic and emotional moments. I won't say much about the plot; only that you need to watch this movie immediately if you haven't already so that you can experience its greatness firsthand. The brilliance of this movie lies in the fact that there are no ""heroes"" or ""villains."" Only people who do what they believe is right for themselves and their families, even if it means going against the rest of the world. I'm honestly not exaggerating when saying that this movie is quite possibly the best film I have ever watched."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Davidisaacson69,9,7 December 2014,"This movie is truly a masterpiece. It is nearly flawless, and was remarkably realistic. No need for mob stereotypes ..... Just a conservative portrayal of a family with deep roots. Remarkable, and a treat to watch over again. It's too bad Brando was a bit of a flake, because he is probably the best actor that ever lived. Every character is complex, but I think my favourite must be Sonny. A hot headed son who is expected to take the reigns of the family one day, in spite of older brother Fredo. I was a kid when it came out but I would love to see it on the big screen. I also find the ages of the actors interesting... Pacino and Caan were very close in age despite Caan as being portrayed as years older. Duvall is actually considerably older than those two. And Abe Vagota is the oldest living cast member."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),katarina-z-stankovic,10,17 February 2014,"Excellent story, a perfect scenario. Great actors and director has made the movie a masterpiece. This is a film that does not leave you indifferent after watching. For a long time I had to force myself to watch this movie. I now regret that I did not saw it before because I didn't started in time to appreciate the Al Pacino acting and Francis Copolla work. And of course, it is needless to mention the excellent work of Marlon Brando. This movie makes you to fall in love with New York in the 1920s, and to wish that you were born in that time. This is one of those rare movies whose II and III part are not ruininig the whole story and the overall impression of the film. The second and third sequel even more complete story. In addition to the excellent story and acting, and you will enjoy the artistic dimension of this masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Franklin-16,10,10 January 2002,"The reason why I value this movie so high, is because of the brilliant casting of its players. Especially the young and not yet well-known Al Pacino. The director Coppola insisted that Al Pacino would play Micheal while the production company wanted someone else. The great pressure on Al Pacino to proof himself as a worthy actor is perfectly seen during the entire movie.  Its seems that Pacino has a lack of self confidence which fits the exactly the type of character he has to play. In The Godfather 3 you see an entire different Al Pacino. His qualities are already well known and thus there's no need to proof himself anymore."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Archie Gates,10,25 May 1999,"What more could you ever want from a film?! The Godfather, created by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, is an absolutely mind boggling film. The acting is brilliant! Brando, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall are masterful actors. The topic, the mafia, fascinating. The motif and symbolism (shaded eyes, oranges for death), stunning and so well presented. The transitions (edition), genius.  Most of all, watch for the wonderful cinematography...Coppola knows how to shoot a hell of a film! I personally don't believe any other film can compare to this movie. Truly a masterpiece and revolutionary in setting higher standards in filmmaking."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),doncirilo-40455,10,18 June 2017,"The film, the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, is one of the most accomplished film creations of all time. It is not only the montage of the same, also the plot, costume, interpretation of the actors, and the intrinsic message that contains. The film is timeless, it does not matter in the year that was made, because at any time is a reference of a well-done story and good cinema. The subject of the mafia always intrigues, everyone wants to know about it regardless of what they consider, whether it is good or bad, because they are well-planned organizations in which discipline, and respect for the word do functional. The godfather collects all these elements, jointly by the love for the family, and not only the family of the home, but family is the whole organization. This film must always be a paradigm of exquisite cinema. The godfather is one of the best films of all time."

The story and acting are superb. Hell, Marlon Brando as The Godfather is a reason enough to watch this film. It really feels as Coppola had some inside informant give him insight on how things work in a mafia family. They are many other crime movies but in my opinions none of those is on the same level as ""The Godfather""(that's not saying they are bad or of inferior quality of course)."

This makes it impossible to watch this film with a truly open mind. Anyone wait bing this film will most likely have very high expectations for this alleged masterpiece.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mikeramirez304,5,29 July 2014,"On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Don Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the head of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital; his jaw is broken by Police Captain McCluskey, who is also Sollozzo's bodyguard. Sonny retaliates for the attacks on his father by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael accepts their offer to meet in a Bronx restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun, and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie and threatens to kill him if he abuses her again. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Devastated by Sonny's death, Vito decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for his son's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to a father saddened by his involvement in the family business and marries Kay the next year. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising Kay that he will make the business legitimate within five years. To that end, he insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a ""wartime consigliere""; the older man agrees Tom should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signaling his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Barzini, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Blake_McGovern,10,16 May 2024,"Somehow 3 hours seem to flow on by faster than you can imagine. By far, the best directing in any movie I have ever seen. It is unbelievable how separate plotlines weave into one-another so perfectly. Despite being killers every character is so real and understandable. I can imagine living as each character and following the same paths they had as fate dictated. I don't believe that any movie will or has captured the pure magic of this movie. I am fully engage and in awe every time I watch this movie. I follow the stereotype of short attention spans among young people, but I cannot say that I was ever taken out of the movie or bored for even a second from the first line to the last, a feat only achieved by this and The Shawshank Redemption. The only criticism I have ever heard about this movie is that it is too slow, but I don't see it. There are no moments that left me bored, each moment is packed with pure entertainment, and every moment without dialogue or action is filled with incredible music that lets you ponder and digest the events that just transpired. That raises another point in how incredible the music is. The main theme is captivating like I have never seen before. It is so recognizable and unique. It has become a joke among my friends who I initially watched this movie with to play the main theme whenever there is any violence or talk about money. I even hum it without even realizing. I bring this movie up every time I need to make conversation with someone who was old enough to remember the release of this movie. There is something about it that separates it from all other movies. It perfectly entails everything great about movies and is the peak of entertainment."

Father 1 and father 1 after father 2 in the movie before the father is a father of mafia tells the state. In 3, he tells about his father's life after himself. Alpacino is Alpacino in the film Baba is a film. After Dad's film, he's already taken the wounded face. But many people who know father film do not know wounded film. A wounded face is one of the films that can try a masterpiece among mafia movies in the movie. The point based on the film was the point of importance to the family. How much a man is a father of mafia, there is a family that should look after him. The Godfather, the leader of many mafia leaders, has also opened a new style among the mafia. The Carlin family, which determined an image that would never be destroyed, has entered into legendary films with the father film. The Godfather is adapted from the same book by Mario Puzo. In the film, we will observe the developments around an Italian mafia family living in America, and we will get to know them closely. Michael Corleone, the family's youngest son, who joined the army to get away from her business, who is opposed to her father, takes on the job she does not love to save them from the difficult situation her family falls into.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),drunkenglishman,1,21 January 2021,Such a boring movie. I'm a very well established psychiatrist and I was disgusted and bewildered by the lack of care the characters had for themselves in this film. What on earth was Michael Corleone doing not taking antidepressants?! Michael was a very depressed character and the fact he didn't seem to take any antidepressants in this film baffles me as I thought that would've been obvious for him to do.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mbnew2003,10,19 February 2002,"There really isn't much you can say about The Godfather because it is simply the best movie ever made and anyone who says otherwise knows nothing about films. The storyline is superb, the actors are excellent and the music is good too.  I thought Al Pacino should have gotten something for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. Funny how he never got a Golden Globe or Oscar for this part but yet it's that character that he is known for most. Francis Ford Coppola got this production perfect down to the smallest detail. This movie is truly a work of art and no other film has even come close to its stature. It is a triumph no other movie has been able to recreate! Everybody around the world must see this film at least once!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sol_justice,10,12 January 2005,If there is one way to run a business its like Don Vito Corleone there is no way to describe the sheer brilliance of this film i will never forget it as long as i live. Although he is no longer alive Marlon Brando is in my book one of the greatest actors. I don't recall blinking once through the whole movie and although the movie is a little cheese in the visual effects it becomes timeless by having such a classic setting like the 1940's new york. Thing i loved best was the characters and how they each changed through out the film although the time span was skewed so as to not be able to tell how much time had gone by the way the characters acted was enough of a clue to show vast amounts of change in time and life. I loved this movie for many reasons but when i grow up i wanna be like Mikey Corleone

The camera work is fine but there's nothing else there in the movie to compensate for the mediocre plot and cliche Italian accent portrayed by the actors though there is a seen in the movie that is funny, The scene is in the beginning of the movie where the men break fbi guys camera at the wedding. I never liked Al pacinos acting but Marlon Brando is a good actor so I feel like the producers could done a better job with Marlon Brando. Overall a overrated mediocre movie there's nothing wrong with liking it but I personally don't and I wouldn't recommend to watch it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alimansoury,10,28 March 2024,"I'm struggling to put into words how incredible this movie was. After reading the reviews here, I find it difficult to add anything new, as they've already articulated what makes The Godfather so remarkable. Having watched countless films, both exceptional and lackluster, I can confidently say that The Godfather surpasses them all. Its imagery, intricacies, and memorable scenes have lingered in my mind since I watched it just nine hours ago. The film's craftsmanship and performances elevate it above other remarkable works I've seen, leaving me unable to identify any flaws. While The Godfather may be considered slow-paced and its plot unfolds gradually, these aspects contribute to its elegiac tone and unpredictability. At 18, I was uncertain whether I'd appreciate or comprehend the film, but I found it accessible and can now fully appreciate its status as a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dante_2505,9,3 August 2013,"I can say that this isn't just good movie, it's amazing, it's not just one of the best, it's the best movie I've ever seen. What an idea, what a music, what a brave of characters in this movie. I read book of Mario Puzo a year ago, all the movies in this trilogy I had seen for 3-4 years. Book is also great, but I definitely like movie much. Sometimes I compare it to ""Once upon a time in America"", there is such an idea I think, but greater is Godfather I mean. 10 stars out 10. I didn't give such a point to any movie... Still the best however I have seen about 100-150 movies. I don't think something will change for me in future so Godfather will be the greatest one for me."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),esmaesrahamurcu,10,25 June 2022,"It's a legend!! The best film ever i've seen.. <3 al pacino did his best and i've started to admire him after i watched this film!! Scenes were avesome and cast was also adorable and the story was unusual. Actually, when i think about what is the beauty and what is unforgettable for me in this life, i always remember this film!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tindfoting,10,31 May 2022,"I love The Godfather. Sitting here with my overexpensive, 4K box, which tells me in big letters that this is the 50th anniversary for the greatest movie ever made, make me feel old. It was made the year before I was born, and I first saw it in... 1982, 9 years old, with my dad. I didn't get much of the story, but got hypnotized by the awesome beginning with Brando's speech and the wedding. My lifelong obsession as a film geek was truly lit. There's something really special about it, that other movies lacks. Some critics says it glamorishes the mafia. Don't agree at all. It's a movie about family, and in glimpses we see the power and violence Vito Corleone possesses. And if anyone thinks it glamorises the mob, they are beyond stupid. It anything, the trilogy tells about the corruption of the human soul, when Michael Corleone goes full in to be the next Don, with some incredible violent scenes edited into the bapthism of Michael's own godson. He sold his soul, but he doesnt care. It's beautiful told, because Coppolla happens to be a great director, with incredible actors around. Seems I'm in minority thinking the 1st is the best. Mostly because it's ""my precious favorite"", but Part II has a bit to much politics that doesnt involve The Corleone's directly, so I will always find it ""inferiour"". It's a great, great movie, none the less. Now I'm looking forward to finally see the revised The Godfather Part III in full 4K. Maybe I will finally embrace it as a part of a great trilogy?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bsilvey,9,18 August 2003,"No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness."

The head of the Don Carleone clan conducts business in the old way, honoring all mafia traditions. However, gradually there are people who are trying to establish new orders. The main roles of the film are played by two movie legends - Marlon Brando and Al Pacino."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tiktuk-70818,8,19 January 2022,"What is The Godfather for us today? We know that this is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema, for most people it is, in principle, the very embodiment of the word ""cinema"". This is the ideal of authorial dramatic cinema, which is close and understandable to a wide range of viewers. It is an integral part of popular culture, broken into quotes, images and memes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mr_S_HasNat,10,10 May 2020,"This is the best gangster movie I have ever seen. Acting, Story, Action all things are amazing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidgfarrell,10,6 June 2005,"There is little to add to the comments on this message board and numerous other sources- The Godfather is simply the best movie released. Not ""Best Gangster Movie"", not ""Best Mafia Movie""- there are no qualifiers needed. The movie captures so many elements of great cinema- story, casting, writing, direction, production qualities, that it rises above every other movie released. See this movie and marvel at the transformation of Michael Corleone, the intensity of Sonny, the ineptness of Fredo, the emptiness of Connie and how Tom Hagen calculates every move, always looking for the acceptance from the rest of the family. Vito Corleone is a study of cunning abilities. The family looks to him for guidance and advice, even while the world is moving so quickly to overtake them."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adammecke,10,18 April 2018,The story....the cinematography...and the actors! And ol the actors are at there best. Line after line and the inesity that makes part of the family through out this film. You relate to them in a way that you root for the gangster

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amosweislib,1,16 June 2020,"And somebody has to do something about this hype
Honestly
bad acting, boring and shallow plot
the movie is beeing watched only due to its hype"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OPERATOR-4,10,23 July 1999,"""The Godfather"" is, in my opinion, the best gangster movie ever created.  I like this movie for its superior directing and excellent storytelling.  This movie shows us that even gangsters are born human beings. They face victory and defeat about as much as any other group of people.  Despite its graphic intensity, I found myself paying very close attention to the emotions of the main family.  I'd say that it is a step above ""The Untouchables"".  Anyone interested in major film classics should see the original ""Godfather"" at least one time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Andreus3000,10,9 March 2018,"Francis Ford Coppola & Mario Puzo bring the famed-mafia novel to life. The Godfather is an excellent portrayal of power, betrayal and family. Beautifully written and stunningly executed, the film is a landmark motion picture with stunning performances (Brando, Pacino, Caan) that is still held up to this day as a timeless classic.
Spectacular. Every time I see it, it gets better. From its flawless direction, to its exceptional score, to its (near-)flawless script, I have no doubt ""The Godfather"" is one of the best movies ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ResonantHawk,10,21 August 2005,"A Masterpiece of its time and all time, this movie defined the term - ""blockbuster movie"" and set the ultimate limit for a cinematic masterpiece. No one would have ever believed that this movie would have such an impact on popular, mainstream American cinema. The executives of the studio that funded this movie's production just seemed to keep their fingers crossed and hoped that the movie wouldn't bomb really bad in the box office. Their fears were not unreal. They were taking a mammoth risk by funding a movie to be directed by a 'risk taking, not so popular' director starring many unknown actors in major roles and to top it all, the story was to be adapted from a decently popular fictional novel. All these factors could have kept this movie down. If it weren't for the amazing talent exploited really very well in every department, aspect of the movie, their worst fears would have been realized. ""The Godfather"" established many careers and gave life to many interesting personalities to have ever graced the screen. A ""Definite Watch"" for anyone who wants to know what a 'perfect, no non-sense movie' is all about and also in general, an engrossing movie that grows on you over time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RalphXLauren,10,8 February 2024,"This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vittoriocosanostra,10,7 August 2020,"Good movie. I thought it was cool! In addition to having a lot of action, there is a lot of drama. The Godfather is the best movie ever, Michael Kyle said. In my opinion it is the best."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dipeshjangir,9,3 April 2017,"This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),followdaleede83,10,6 June 2001,"What can I say other than this is the greatest film ever made.  The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is exquisite.  The screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo is very rich in detail.  The best thing about the movie however is the cast.  Whoever was casting director on this film did a fantastic job.  I mean, Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Keaton, Cazale...they all deserved one big Oscar.  10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),colindrayton,3,16 October 2022,"Money or materialism is the embodiment of human greed and the way the gangsters go about their lives, breaking laws and committing barbaric animalistic acts of terror just for money is a poor cultural showcase to people around the world.

A film which truly captured my mind and also my thoughts, I just went berserk watching the film and I cant able to come out from the trance because every little detail in the film was totally went over the top and it made more beautiful and sharp, the one point we all should admit is that this piece needs to be released in 20's era, because everyone will have a scope to witness in big screen and ofcourse this is supposed to witness and enjoy on big screen, and cast and crew everyone did their best to bring this output."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),miltongioianeto,10,23 July 2022,I did not know what art was until I was introduced to this love poem. Even better than the book. Godfather represents the history of America's immigration. In other words: a história da minha família.

There are such countless pictures, subtleties and scenes that I genuinely can't escape my head since watching it interestingly only nine hours prior. The Godfather is so extraordinarily very much made and acted that it stands apart among most of those other astounding movies I've seen, to such an extent I was unable to consider a solitary blemish, and I am battling to consider a sufficient motivation to why I didn't see this film before now.

There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago.

Brando brings a nuanced complexity to the character, presenting Vito as a man both feared and respected, with a deep sense of honor and loyalty."

An instant master piece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elgee,9,3 January 2000,"Most of the superlatives have been said about this Movie, adjectives such as magnificent, brilliant and searing all attach themselves to most reviews of the Film and, deservedly so. The Godfather is the definative story of the Mafia and it's bid for legitimacy and respect from Political allies and Law Enforcement groups eager to sympathize in order to capitalize. While the show is informing us, or rather reminding us of time honoured liaisons between the law makers and the law breakers in mid 20th Century America, with scenes of Movie Producers waking up and finding parts of a horses' anatomy sharing satin sheets, employees of the Don getting garrotted in public bars and  front seats of company vehicles, the hazards of stopping your car at toll booths, and Police Captains choking over bits of lead during their meal, we learn also of the significence of that well worn cliche..........'Give him an offer he can't refuse.'  Yeah..... bloodthirsty stuff indeed, but apparently stuff we all enjoy watching, particularly when it's directed by guys like Francis Coppola and embellished with stars like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall. The Godfather is a milestone Movie, superbly adapted from Mario Puzo's book that dares to explore the depth of Mafia guilt and Political conscience."

Besides,Michael learned the ropes because of his father,who was in the mafia,idiots.And for the user who said that this is typical American trash,I've got to say:.In fact,you're lucky we have movies that don't revolve around tea drinking crumpet eating idiots who just sit around the whole time talking about their day at the country club.And besides,British actors SUCK!But back to the point,the Godfather is THE best movie of all time,and if you don't agree,then IDC,you're an idiot,or a pot smoker.Thanks for reading!And if you have any intellectual response to this,please post."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ian-smith,10,6 July 2005,"To begin with, I had not seen the Godfather, nor its subsequent sequels, until about two years ago. I have only one thing to say about this: Why? Why did I not see this sooner? Francis Ford Coppolla creates a brilliantly haunting masterpiece, full of drama, and perfectly sets the mood, entrancing you frame by frame into the world of legalized crime. Marlon Brando shines in quite possibly his greatest performance ever as the Don Vito Corleone. While he may not appear to be a truly menacing figure, as the viewer you instantly respect him with the way he carries himself and his words. Brando's range of emotions, the way every line he speaks is with conviction of a man who is so wise, truly defines the character that I'm not sure anyone originally thought could be so strong. The next main cast standout is Al Pacino, who gives here a staggering performance as Vito's youngest son, Michael. The transformation of his character is absolutely incredible, from the mild-mannered Captain in the United States Marine Corps, to the future and eventual Godfather of the Corleone Family. Pacino completely grasps his role and takes on an entirely different life himself, to the point where we forget he is an actor. The rest of the cast is extremely superb, all the way down to the most minute character. Perhaps the two most touching scenes are 1) When Michael visit's his father in the hospital after the attempted murder at the hands of the Tattaglia family, and 2) After James Caan's character, Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone, is albeit brutally shot numerous times, and Vito Corleone asks the mortuary to ""use all of his powers"" to fix his son, because he ""didn't want his mother to see him like this."" This is truly a magnificent story, filled with betrayal, family loyalty, and eventual heartbreak. A marvelous masterpiece from both Copolla and Mario Puzo, who wrote the screenplay (and the later who wrote the novel). And to think that Paramount almost fired both Copolla and Pacino because they weren't the first choices! That would have been an insult! If that had happened, I would not be here, commenting on this movie, because it would not have been anywhere near as beautiful of a film. If you haven't seen this yet, see it now! Don't wait another minute! If you have, watch it again. And again. And again. Now, I'm going to end this review, and watch it myself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),conace21,10,12 July 2003,"Coppola, Brando, and Pacino all overcame early doubters to come up with terrific work. Brando is remembered most for this performance ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" Pacino's career took off following his portrayal of Michael, the war hero-turned-ruthless Mafia head. Coppola's brilliance is evident from the very beginning, with Vito entertaining the undertaker in the dimly lighted office. One of the finest films ever made."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samcheshier,8,9 December 2014,"In a college level FILM 249 course Fall 2014, we studied the film ""The Godfather"". What I suggest a viewer watch for during the film is oranges and the color orange. The purpose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of this may be to foreshadow any danger or violence. In multiple instances throughout the movie an orange or the color orange is seen with or on someone that is involved in a violent act. For example, there is a bowl of oranges in front of Woltz at dinner and he wakes up with a horse head in between his legs. Another example is when Don Corleone is shot multiple times he topples to the ground, spilling a produce setup of oranges."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tmacfan19,10,10 February 2007,"I had heard about this movie (who hasn't really?) and I had a desire to watch this film. Yet, I couldn't because no one I knew had it, and I couldn't buy it. So, I decided to get the next best thing, and I read the book. I read the book in about a week, and I was astonished that such a book had existed and I hadn't read it before. So, my desire to watch the film was greater than it had ever been before. Finally, I was able to watch it. And, my God in Heaven. If I could, I would name my first born child Don Corleone (that's a joke) and make him look exactly like Marlon Brando. The acting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, everything is fantastic. The only thing I can critique on is the action, and the fact that it was semi-cheesy. But, this is too be expected, as it was made in the early 70's, before great special effects. Despite this, I'd give this film 11/10."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),l-64317-97959,10,2 June 2020,"After watching ""the godfather"" intermittently, my blood was boiling. The film left a deep impression on me in two aspects, one is the cold revenge, and the other is the warm affection. I have always dreamed of being able to have the supreme voice like godfather corleone when I am about to grow old. I also dream of having a happy family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),durd,10,9 February 2007,"There is only one word to describe The Godfather and that word is ""beautiful"". I say this because of the way the film is crafted. The beginning starts out with that most memorable theme tune and then cuts to a discussion in the room of Don Vito Corleone."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zoomtravel,10,23 December 2022,"I love this, I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sahpaio,10,8 August 2020,"The Godfather is a complicated film, with a really intricate storyline. And it never stops, or slows itself for explanations.

It's brilliant."

The Godfather is a True cinematic Masterpiece. Bravo!If there are any holes, weaknesses or inconsistencies, I have yet to discover them. I've watched it at least 8-10 times and it blows me away every single viewing. GF2 was excellent, but not nearly as tightly written, several holes in the story that simply don't add it, but still a great film in it's own right. GF3 - very underrated indeed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pengembara-sepi,10,2 March 2014,"good movie to watch, and not bored to watch it again and again, because there is romance in this film, drama and also the most important action. So those of you who have not watched it please immediately and instantly watch, and those of you who've seen it, can watch again. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vugarakbarli,9,11 August 2021,The best of best. It is my favroite movie. Many of my friends said it is not good but I like this style movies and I think it is the best one. This movie is not only about crime but also shows us what is the family and what is loyality.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Gina-Torres-U,10,9 October 2017,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather"" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. With performances, style and substance to savor, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless. This is a world where emotional ties are strong, loyalties are somewhat more flexible at times, and tempers are short."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),keenan-robinson,8,25 December 2014,"I have seen the whole Godfarther trilogy and I would consider this to be the second best of the series. I would put this film in the same class of Lawrence of Arabia, Citzen Cane, and Casablanca which are all great films. I just feel that they are giving far to much praise that is not deserved. People even consider this the greatest film of all time which makes me scratch my head because the second one is far superior. With that being said, what makes this movie is Marlon Brando's Performance. Evan though he considered to young for the Role of Vito Corleone, he seems to pull it off without any effort. Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, also brings it in this film playing a Character that want to desperately avoid the criminal world that his family is involved in but is forced to get involved due to circumstances that I will not Spoil. The cast is this film is superb and they all play character that come across as real and fleshed out. You actually believe they are related to one another. This combined with an interesting plot makes for great watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is new to mobster movies and is trying to get the feet wet. This is one of Francis Ford Coppala's best."

Based on Mario Puzo's novel, the film delves deep into the intricate world of the Corleone family, offering a compelling portrayal of power, loyalty, and the American Dream. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the formidable patriarch whose influence extends far beyond his criminal empire."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gegoll,5,4 April 2014,"The Godfather is among the hardly any films that does not have one flaw. Seeing The Godfather for The very first time was one of the most amazing Motion picture activities of my daily life. There is scenes that stay with you when the films over, therefore you remember them. Anyone can make the mistake of calling this film a Motion picture about criminal offense. Its definitely a Film about relatives. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I have observed the Film a minimum of 30, forty instances, and I'm nonetheless stunned at how excellent it is. The tunes, the performing, every little thing. Folks think that Citizen Kane is the greatest Motion picture at any time produced...perfectly, there's no way that ANYONE can believe Citizen Kane is a lot more moving, and it has a greater storyline compared to the Godfather. The matter I locate so astounding concerning the Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) improvements throughout the movie. Its my impression this is the greatest movie ever designed, and I doubt that any one can look at this Motion picture, and Believe I am ridiculous."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cpaniccia,10,9 July 2020,"The movie delivers from scene one. Looking into the compelling underbelly of the criminal world know as the Mob, it shows the growth of an empire. The Holy Grail of Gangster Movies upon which all others are compared."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carlosabadia-16030,9,14 October 2023,"Cinematically talking is one of the best movies ever recorded. Apart from the storyline, and the starring cast, which astonishingly, with actors such as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando as the godfather, ... The shots taken are measured to the millimetre. That is what makes the movie entertaining from the beginning to the last shot of the film. The Francis Ford Coppola script based on the Mario Puzo's book makes you being engaged and wanting to follow the whole movie. Furthermore, the music background is one of the best ever composed for a cinema movie. Exclusively made for The Godfather."

Maybe it's the score, cinematography, or the memorable characters, but there's just something about the Godfather that sticks with you. It's one of those movies that gets loved more and more as time goes on. It's one of those movie's you wish you could watch again for the first time. It's a movie in everyone top ten. It's a movie I'll be showing my kids. The Godfathers a journey of a reluctant son becoming the thing he swore he'd never become. A businessman, a killer, a Criminal. The Godfather is, without a doubt, one of the most well crafted cinematic masterpieces of all time."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),majideseraj,8,20 April 2022,"The godfather the best movie With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."

There are very few films that I would give a 10/10 to but the godfather takes the cake with the cherry on top, for those who like a good story, brilliant acting, a bit of the mafia, guns blazing, this is your cuppa, it certainly is mine. Utterly incredible, now I just need to watch part 2 and 3!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),siandreww,5,1 September 2021,Now I understand that this film was groundbreaking... but it didn't do it for me. Marlon Brando was impossible to understand and the plot was so hard to keep a track of. It definitely got better as it went on but did seem to drag for a bit with unnecessary scenes it felt like it should've been a series. I didn't hate it in the slightest and will be watching The Godfather 2 however I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a captivating or lighthearted film.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samsalama,10,24 August 2010,"The Godfather is a 1972 American gangster-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay by Puzo, Coppola, and Robert Towne (uncredited).[3] It stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte and Diane Keaton, and features John Cazale, Talia Shire, Al Martino, and Abe Vigoda. The story spans ten years from 1945 to 1955 and chronicles the fictional Italian American Corleone crime family. Two sequels followed: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JonasArturo,10,6 June 2024,"Direction and Production
As a passionate film enthusiast, I can't help but marvel at the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. His ability to craft an immersive narrative that captivates the audience from the very first scene is truly exceptional. Coppola's talent for developing complex, multifaceted characters is evident in every frame, using cinematography that shifts between light and shadow to symbolize the moral duality of the characters. His choice to shoot many scenes in dimly lit interiors adds a tone of mystery and danger, underscoring the clandestine nature of the Corleone family's activities."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stonan69,10,3 May 2004,"The truly amazing performance by Marlon Brando as the ageing mob-boss Vito Corleone is not the only stroke of brilliance in this film. The performance by the then young Al Pacino as the youngest son Micheal was also first class. His portrayal as a young man, recently out of the army, who was determined to stay well out of his fathers business but through a series of events transformed is quite stunning. Far greater than part two and one of the best films ever made. Supported by great performances by Robert Duvall as the families adopted son and lawyer Tom Hagen and James Caan as Vito's psychotic eldest son Sonny, Brando's portrayal comes believingly to life in this fantastic film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hamzabounkoub,10,10 April 2018,"A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cartaclaudio,10,27 September 2005,"The best gangster movie of all times. A can't miss movie. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are spectacular and give an excellent performance. If anyone wants to know how Mafia lived, this is the best example to see. Marlon Brando stars as Vito Corleone is purely a Don. The soundtracks are great although sometimes the movie is sometimes slow, but keeps the interest and excitement in you throughout the whole movie. In this movie Michel Corleone(Pacino) makes his way into his family's business to protect his father and himself until he becomes the new Don. Francis Ford Cappola made the right decisions in casting especially with Pacino although all the oppositions he had with the producers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rachanapaina,8,8 March 2020,"When I listened from my friends that this movie is a master piece and I saw that Metacritic has given it a100% than I thought that this is a true master piece.
But when I saw the movie,I felt that it's a great movie but not the greatest, as we should have some idea of the novel before watching it,so as to know what is happening in the movie ,also we don't know when the time is passing in the movie because they don't show after how many years is a event occuring in the movie (If you are confused of what I am talking about then you should see the movie).
However the performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is out standing and the direction of the movie is fabulous. And when you see this crime drama you never feel that the movie is stretched upto 3hrs.
However, it's my opinion about this movie ,according to me ,go for it and I promise you that that you will watch a great holly wood classic that will not disappoint you."

The character development couldn't be better, specially the work they did on Michael. And to top it off, the ending scene is simply a masterpiece. I know that the thought of it being 3 hours long is scary at the beginning, but it will be the best 3 hours of your life.

""The Godfather"" stands as an enduring testament to the power of storytelling and filmmaking. Widely regarded as the greatest movie of all time, this cinematic gem has transcended its genre, leaving an indelible mark on both the film industry and popular culture. Several elements contribute to its status as the pinnacle of cinematic achievement."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),The-Larsenator,10,27 July 2017,"Boi, settle in, i respect people's opinion when they say the godfather is overrated but how can you hate a movie that is so well made on all level the acting is above superb everyone does a great job especially the leading men Marlon Brando is spot on with body language voice and general acting, Al Pacino seems bad at first but once he does the shooting scene it goes uphill like very uphill the shooting scene is his best where his eyes tell the whole story its like he is Micheal Corleone at that moment Robert Duvall does great load acting along with James Caan and a lot of the other male characters. The directing is so spot on in my opinion the second best directed film Coppola strives for such realism you can see it in the scene with the dead horse the actor wasn't aware that there would be a dead head in his bed and the head is real from a real horse so is scream is so authentic. The opening scene and ending scenes has so much detail and symbolism that I can't even go into details. The pacing is f.....g amazing you never get bored even thou it's 3 hours long when ever you are close they hit you with a scene that just blow up and you are fully hooked again. The script is amazing a great story and so many quotable lines the story has so many twist and turn and the characters always feel real the dialogue is spot on delivering so much suspense and information so effectively. The Score it's probably the best score of all times I have never heard a score that fits the movie so perfectly and could also work effectively as normal music it delivers so much suspense and, the best pieces are the godfather waltz (the start) and the baptism these pieces deliver suspense information are are just great I sometimes start hearing these pieces in my head because they are so good. The cinematography is also some of the best of its kind the lighting conveys so much information and every scene is framed perfectly every scene could be a painting. And that is just some of the reasons why the godfather is one of the best film of all time and not overrated (I still respect your opinions)."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),apboy2,10,13 January 2000,"""The Godfather"" is a visceral achievement in moviemaking and has a rightful place near the top of any list of the greatest films ever made. It seizes your attention, doesn't let go and takes you down the road promised to immigrants to America -- before taking a turn in which we confront the prejudices, mistrust and other roadblocks to the realization of their dreams, and how they went on to create success on their terms. But I have to put it near the top, not AT the top. That honor, on my list, belongs to ""The Godfather Part II,"" for a reason that it's hard to fault Coppola for. In ""The Godfather,"" I found Michael to be too far outside the family at the beginning of the movie. While not renouncing his father, Sonny or their enterprise, Michael seems to be more of an observer in an Army uniform with his white-bread girlfriend nearby than a family member PLANNING to immerse himself in the life his father and brother have chosen. Obviously Michael is drawn closer to his family as it becomes threatened with, then targeted by, violence. This is understandable but, to me, not foreshadowed by the life outside the family that he had chosen a few years earlier and seemed to be comfortable with. Of course, ""Part II"" gives a much fuller picture of how Michael got to where he was in running the enterprise, and heading the family. But we already know all we need to know about his motives and choices -- courtesy of ""The Godfather."" This deeper, more realized character of Michael in ""Part II"" is the reason I rate it ahead of ""The Godfather"" -- but not by much."

This movie has EVERYTHING, a great script, unforgettable performances and characters, great acting and a MIND-BLOWING story line! I was really surprised on how serious this movie was made and the effort it took to make this into a successful masterpiece! Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is EXCELLENT! I was really enjoying every minute of his screen time and because of his Italian accent and also because he was a very interesting and likable character. The amount of drama that occurs in the film between the five families is absolutely heartbreaking and mind-blowing due to FANTASTIC performances brought to the film! I also really enjoyed Al Pacino's character known as Michael Corleone! I felt that he had a lot of charisma in almost every scene he was in and he tries to avoid being an idiot character and ends up being another likable character throughout the film! I think this is DEFINITELY a film that everybody should see at least once because it is definitely worth a watch for anyone who LOVES watching movies from any genre including myself. The Godfather is a film that HIGHLY surprised me and it's a classic and a masterpiece in movie history and it will stay as one of the GREATEST movie of all time and it has to be the greatest movie I have ever seen and i'm gonna give The Godfather a 10/10."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),huseyinzenginoglu,10,23 May 2021,"In a scene where Marlon Brando should look angry, she's a masterpiece that allows us to see how wonderful an actor she is by bending her vein on her forehead at her own will."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),privat-Micha,10,15 November 2001,"The Godfather and it's two successors are my favourite films,because the Mafia isn't only shown as a criminal organization but also a family affair full of emotions,force and weakness,like in the most lives.The playing of all actors is great,the music of Nino Rota provoke always strong feelings in me if I hear it.Also this music is a part of my favourite soundtrack.I saw the three films many many times and they gave me a understanding of Italian or sicilian mentality.I got a lot of sicilian friends and I surprise them always with my knowledge of their manner of living and thinking.I'm not a criminal guy,but I wish some- times we could have in Germany some Robin-Hood-like Godfathers of the special warm Corleone-kind. Because without them the really criminal and brutal subjects (in our special european case:Eastern Gangsters without a feeling for their victims) will win the play. Forget about protection by Police,the family would do it"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wxm-06382,10,9 November 2023,"This is a really wonderful film, I like it so much, after watching it, I feel that I have experienced the character's life, it gives me some thoughts, what life do I really like? And now, I will give review on this film from three aspects: plot, performance and direct. Firstly, the plot is logical and attractive, which tells a story full of violence and betrayal based on the gangster background. However, it is different from other films because it tells a warm and careful story at the same time. The film shows the power's influence on a person by describing the transaction of the main characterMichael. Secondly, all the actors contribute wonderful and excellent performance, they seem like they are just the characters who living in the film world all the time, all the acts match the characters perfectly. For me, I think the soul of a film is good actors, a great actor can deliver the inner of character to us, which can teach us some life thoughts and experience. Then, about the direct, this film also has a good direct way, as a classic film, its direct way is so wonderful, the film begins with the sentence:I believe America. In the next film, it tries to divert the opinion all the time. And in the film, there have two Montago, which attract me deeply. All in all, the film is a classic and wonderful film, and come back to my thinking, I think I prefer a easy and firm life, trying to accept my own life and control greed in the soul."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),reachrajdream,10,21 June 2006,"Finally i decided to give review on the most popular,role model movie in the world,even though mine would be lost in millions of reviews.Mario Puzo has created this story based on characters with underworld platform.Father,his three sons and one foster son."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thesocialstreem,10,27 July 2023,"One of the best film i have watched. It's an masterpiece movie. Must watched , the best gangster drama as well as setting the best quality film. The best masterpiece. Must watched with friends and family. Like to watched.

Another Blockbuster. Going to be super blast. Full on fire movieAn artist never fails to entertain, all the very best to all the artist connected to this film...No words to express what I'm feeling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gohar-43596,2,28 December 2021,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),leozamudio,10,7 February 2020,"Masterpiece is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but this movie truly lives up to that title."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),antondatree,10,15 March 2002,"There is a reason that films are called the greatest, and The Godfather proves it. Coppola paints a chilling picture of the Corleone family, while the cast, particularly Brando and Pacino are unforgettable. If you haven't seen this movie, then ""whats the matter with you""?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pranaysanghavi-875-899035,10,11 May 2019,"This can't be just a film. Stars should align to make such a product. Nothing more can be said. One can not be told who The Godfather is, you have to see it for yourself."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benchair,10,3 October 2007,"On the 15th of March 1972. I sat in my apartment at the age of 17 with my girlfriend. We decided to go see a movie. We heard that there was some big premier of some sort at the cinemas. We went and saw 'The Godafther'. We expected an average film. But from the minute it started we were stuck into it. Back then we had no idea who Al Pacino, James Caan or Robert Duvall were, but because of this film we now do."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sel-323-814620,10,2 September 2021,Iconic movie no one can't miss it name or forget it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imedghassenfilmfestival,10,15 November 2023,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),howardpaul-99611,10,1 March 2024,"""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ThehumanBarbie215,5,29 November 2021,The godfather is a great movie to watch with the fellas. Its a must watch movie if your into mob movies. Something to watch on a Saturday night. 3 hours long but worth every minute of it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Pilgrim574,10,15 August 2006,"The script was brilliant, the cast superb, the locations, another positive superlative. the whole film, despite being so long I went into Tuesday watching it, when i started on Friday, Was UNBELIEVABLE. The story is amazing, although I'm not going to give it away. Marlon Brando was great and Al Pacino, he played the reluctant son so well, was he brought up like that. he-he! The different characters of everyone: Sonny, the relentless and ruthless one, who comes to a very sticky end, Michael, The reluctant, yet unforgiving son, who goes onto great things, although he just wants the business to be legitimate, and Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, that man can act, a family centred character, Vito Corleone did what he saw necessary to keep his family afloat and in line with the other families."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rifatuls,10,8 December 2013,everyone knows its one of the best movie. but you don't know is this is the movie that comes once in the history... its made me think like i am the godfather. i am the MOB !! you can not say if the actors are acting... its real..
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pyvtdp,10,13 June 2018,"Loan-down movie. hk online casino baccarat site marketing agency
I watched the movie and did not know it was going through time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Chubbs-2,10,21 May 1999,"Citizen Kane ? please, it doesn't even compare to The Godfather. Wrongfully placed 3rd on the all time greatest list of movies, The Godfather is perfection personified. In today's high tech and fast paced times, there will never be a movie with such depth, and meaning as the Godfather. Some say it's a story about crime, but in actuality it's a story on loyalty and betrayal in a family. About how generations evolve, and particularly about the metamorphosis of Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone, turned for a straight war hero, to the ruthless leader of the Corleone Family. Coppolla's vision will forever be labelled his diffinitive work. The saga which is the Godfather is the greatest story ever told, the characters are authentic and the story is timeless. I think those critics must reconsider the final verdict and place The Godfather in it's rightful place, at the top of the movie mountain."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FANKOSH,10,6 February 2019,It is an old movie but it's still amazing and i'm still watching it tbh
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),seshuponnapalli,5,20 June 2017,"The finest mafia film and the finest family i have ever watched. The craft of cinema is at its best in godfather series.Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),avshrinivass,10,30 October 2011,This film has become a cult movie has sorts. No wonder people have seen criticizing it because of the attention it gets and complain about its length. I had the same views while i watched it for the first time. But this film grows on you. People who acquire a taste for the art of film will like this film. The way we journey through a man's life is exciting and refreshing. This movie has set a benchmark in every aspect from dialogues which are its main strength to its performances from powerhouses like Al Pacino and Marlin Brando is a treat to watch. Overall if your a fan of crime stories this movie has to be in your bucket list
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ToPulpForFiction,10,22 June 2003,"this film can truely be identified as a landmark film. It has all the details that make up a true great film. Marlon Brando, Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all great especially Brando. Francis Ford Coppola directs his best movie right here. If you have never seen this classic what a shame, this is truely a classic in every case."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LibraryInChennai,10,24 March 2021,"I really love the theme of the mafia and have probably reviewed most of the films on this topic and this film is the best for me!
It is the first part that all this atmosphere is simply unmatched!
I really love this movie"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Geraldo_Alexandre_Neptune,10,27 April 2021,Amazing cinematography!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidtmorales,5,13 February 2023,"The mafia was in the news a lot then, the public fascinated by the underworld and the shadow government secretly pulling the strings behind every facet of what was then contemporary American life. I love movies based on true events or based on real life people but accuracy is important to me. Godfather tells a great story but it is not an accurate depiction of the mob. For that reason I do not give the movie a high ranking. There are some classic actors and the movie is entertaining enough but it is fantasy and I am a fan of reality. I love the acting and the music is fantastic. Movies like Goodfellas portray a more accurate depiction."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bellabanana93,10,19 October 2017,"The Godfather (1972) is a Classic Crime Drama about an organized crime dynasty ran by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Bando and his goals to pass down the family business to his reluctant son, Michael played by Al Pacino. This feature has aged so incredibly well that you won't even feel like you are watching a movie from the 70s. The Godfather is a beautiful work of art. The acting in the film, the detailed and complex plot, and the editing are among the highlights of the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kunalsharma-06803,10,22 May 2023,"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mykll42,10,1 November 2001,"SPOILERS (kind of... this is a comment on viewer reaction to certain scenes, and how they've changed.  If you haven't seen the film, please don't read this.  It wouldn't make much sense anyways.)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),naturalcalmcanada,9,21 July 2020,"One of the best of all time. The Godfather brings suspense, deep characters and a great plot."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ivankartashov,10,19 January 2022,"The Godfather became a seminal gangster-themed film. This film flew into popular culture ""from two legs"", and the phrases from it became truly winged. In many films, computer games, books, music, there are references to this film masterpiece. The film has become a cult classic and any list of films about gangsters or the mafia is impossible to imagine without mentioning The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MyratBayram,9,29 January 2018,"I believe that families were so close to that fire where nobody makes it back that it almost completely destroyed the notion of old time family powers that reigned the streets, and not only streets but politics as well. This picture is about making a choice that neither of them bode well. Grand Picture."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nackodunk,10,9 February 2013,"Firstly I want to apologize about my writing skill in English. Seriously, this movie was the best movies that ever been made by human. This movie will bring you to a terrific drama about family live. The storyline of this movie will amuse you. You will be brought into the movie as a main character. This movie also invite the viewers to play and think as a mafia. The Godfather also teach us about honor, loyalty, and respect. These are the main idea of this movie. Al Pacino's performance really added something to this movie. But don't you ever forget about the wise Marlon Brando performance guys. Marlon and Al really got into the movie, they acted like they are a real mafia on the real life. I can't tell you a better movies than The Godfather. If you never watch this movie, you better watch it now ! The word that close to describe The Godfather is FANTASTIC."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scottatkinson-14155,9,25 January 2020,Awesome movie recomend it to everyone because i think everyone needs to watch it. outstanding filmaking and i will watch it many more times for sure its that good

That all production is perfect, music, actors without exception, history, etc. It does not bore and at all times keeps you aware of what will happen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),houyhwt,10,26 February 2018,This Movie is not only the best movie of all time but Marlon Brandos performance of Don Corelones cool collected mafia boss persona is one that will not leave you.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),unrefusable-offer,10,24 January 2011,"Not many movies can be called ""The Perfect Movie"". However, in my humble opinion, The Godfather can be called as such. Everything about this movie (again, in my opinion, all of this) was spectacular."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),calvin-crenshaw-2095,10,30 August 2013,"Just to start off. With director/writer Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay Mario Puzo. And boasting a star studded cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,Abe Vigoda to name a few. In my humble opinion there was little to no chance that this wouldn't be a standard setting blockbuster movie. This is the story of the Corelione Italian mafia family and their rise in power as well as a look inside the family business with a emphasis on their relationship with each other. Their struggles to keep control of the family power and the internal struggles and pressures of mob versus mob fighting to end the Coreleone family control. Due to events that occur cause Don Coreleone to think about stepping down to bring young Michael(Al Pacino)to the head of the family business of which he is reluctant and self doubting if he is up for the responsibility that goes with the title. I can not say enough about how well this is written,directed and acted. I gave it a 10 and I firmly believe it was totally justified. Hope you enjoy this as much as I did. Cal"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yohansankalpa,10,5 April 2021,What a beautiful plot and story and role played by the actors. That's absolutely brilliant.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aml60,10,15 September 2005,"When I first saw this movie, I was amazed. It became one of my favorite movies of all time. The Godfather is a mix of perfect Directing, Story Telling, and Acting. Marlon Brando of course was great as Don Vito, Al Pacino was awesome as Michael, Robert DuVall, James Caan, James Cazale, and Diane Keaton were all great in this movie. The thing I like most about the movie is that, although it is fictional, it is very accurate on how the Italian Mafia was. I mean the realism of the Crime Family and all the conflicts that they had with other rival Families. Francis Ford Coppolla and Mario Puzo did a awesome job on adapting the original novel to the screenplay. It is just simply magnificent. 10/10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),petergriffingaming,5,20 March 2021,"I did not care about the godfather, It insists upon itself"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Morteza_Mogharrab,10,4 January 2022,"Awesome! A great movie that helps us to enjoy the old-fashioned styles along with war, mafia, drama. I am always a super fan of this genre and want to rewatch this movie so many times."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rola-2,10,2 December 2000,I'm a member of Generation X and was born the year THE GODFATHER was released.  I didn't see it until about 5 years ago and was mesmerised at the ability of film to translate a tale with such a respect for the characters it is portraying.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JoyalLobo-94,9,18 July 2023,"I don't recall how many times have I rewatched, revisited scenes but the learning has been new every time I watched. This film is that old teacher who, no matter how old the teacher gets, he/she still teaches you the lessons that need to be learned."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ksteinmetz_62,10,30 October 2001,"Simply put, the standard by which all other films are measured.  Two of the greatest acting performance of all time by Pacino and Brando create two of the most memorable film characters of all-time, the gentlemanly don Vito Corleane and his reluctant son/heir Micheal.  Full of great moments (the horse head in the movie producer's bed, the chilling baptism scene) and great lines this is Coppolla greatest film by far.  The score and cinematography only add to this film's mastery.  A terrific film, one that anyone who calls himself a movie fan should see at least once, and probably many many times!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abakarova-28530,9,19 January 2022,"The Godfather... This film is not so much about bandits, but about the life and broken destinies of people. The film is entirely filled with some drama and experiences of all the main characters!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kimmishy5,10,22 July 2020,"I can watch this movie over and over again... One of the best movies of all time. Every body's good in this movie especially
Al Pacino. A true classic!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gabrielrindborg,10,17 December 2017,"I don't tend to re-watch films, but the Godfather has been one of the few films I have not only re-watched countless times, but enjoyed every second of."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amir_lives,10,24 September 2018,"Godfather such a beautiful movies. My favourite Sir Marlon Brando at his best. The scene where Don's adopted son sings a song at his sisters wedding is so natural that you feel its not an acting its reality. 
A must must watch..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),malakigalloway,10,26 September 2022,"The Godfather is about life and how to deal with everyday people, it's about respect, and most importantly it's about family. I love how Francis Ford Coppola was able to show the evolution of Michael Corleone in a way that was not at all expected. For anyone out there who loves Mafia movies and to not let people take advantage of you I highly recommend this movie. At the end always try to make people offers they can't refuse. One last thing I really didn't like when Michael orders his brother to get killed, I know it's all about family, but you he shouldn't have gone that far, because that actually made his life more darker and that's what we saw at the last release."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rec-1,10,23 March 2001,"The Godfather is without doubt the greatest film ever written and produced. All credit to Mario Puzo, one must remember that the story was written back in the 70's, when so little was known about the Mafia. Coppolla has taken an absolute masterpiece and transformed it into an epic. This film has set a standard, that, in my opinion, has not been reached by another gangster movie since."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ziancara,10,26 May 2023,"In the realm of cinematic brilliance, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather stands tall and unyielding, a true masterpiece that transcends time and leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of filmmaking. With its compelling narrative, masterful storytelling, and impeccable craftsmanship, The Godfather deserves nothing short of a perfect 10 rating."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thowen1988,10,26 October 2006,'The Godfather' is perhaps the greatest American film ever made.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnlerenaissance,10,5 December 2018,"Impeccable cast, impeccable directing and impeccable story. Godfather is the only film that you can be locked in a cell months on end with it in front of you and it wouldn't be considered torture."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sunjupattar,10,15 May 2006,"""The Godfather"" is indeed a re-defining moment in the long and elegant history of the Celluloid.It includes every true aspect of a true movie. The Godfather will appeal to any viewer with its brilliant treatment and way of storytelling.Francis Ford Coppola tells the story of the Italian crime families that ruled vice in the ""Post-Depression"" America.The spotlight is thrown on the rise of the Corleone family and its head,Don Vito Corleone(portrayed by Marlon Brando).The fierce fights among the other families for ultimate glory..and for survival is captured with stunning reality by Coppola.A 'young' Al Pacino has excelled as the aging Don's faithful son who has ""his own plans"" for his life but later takes up the family's responsibilities due to his fight with Fate.Coppola remains true to the title as he pictures the heavenly rise of a man who fought with his own conscience to achieve that ultimate seat of The Godfather of Vice."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),movierulzcomcom,8,17 August 2023,"The story is really interesting and no doubt I will recommend this to my each friend, this is the best film I have seen this year. The story is really interesting and holds your attention all the way through. The Godfather is more than just a regular film; it's a really important and special one that deeply connects with the audience. Marlon Brando's acting as Don Vito Corleone is amazing and makes you feel like he's a powerful and complicated character dealing with crime in a special way."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),makiisinlovewithnori,5,25 January 2019,"Nice one, finest character!...............................cool!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gulherme,10,8 February 2016,"The Godfather is one of the most epic movie of all times, this story is about one family and how they can change the society to achieve they goals. More than it is how a familiar drama can change our personality, the mafia way of life is a background to find redemption for our personal decisions. The story shows how a average man become a leader, for good and for bad, the process is hard and cost tears, blood and a piece of our souls. We learn from this thriller that we can't control our destiny, and even our reactions to life challenges isn't full of ourself, in essence great part of our acts is just instinct. This is the main argument and lesson here, we can't make plans in the long run, but we can train to respond to new obstacles. In familiar and professional career our dreams always will be submitted to the reality."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),drewrobledo,10,29 February 2012,"What can I say about this magnificent and vital piece to both cinema and cinematic history? I remember watching the film on a whim during this recent summer; and I was starstruck while watching it as I experienced both the films beauty and preternatural intensity. Francis Ford Coppola knew how to adapt Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" with infinite, unquestionable and miraculous perfection! Anyone who has watched the film isn't just watching it-they're living it! We feel the bursts of the Don Corleone's (Marlon Brando) fiery, we tear at his beautifully philosophically spoken dialogue, and we feel the immense power and influence his character possesses...Al Pacino as Michael Corleone also holds us in with infinite gravity that we cannot resist nor rebel against. He moves, we watch. He speaks, we listen--all while being mesmerized at his unfortunate, yet incredible transition from the beginning and end of the film"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),melikakkaya-75375,10,31 March 2021,The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rushikesh_Sarode,9,7 December 2023,"The movie is a meditation on power, family, and loyalty, and it asks questions about what people are willing to do to protect those they love. The portrayal of the Mafia as an organization with a strict code of honor also fascinated audiences, as did the movie's exploration of the immigrant experience in America."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),z-10752,10,10 November 2023,"The Godfather is a classic of classics, this film gives me the feeling is the texture, the logic is tight, the foivography is natural, the lens language is delicate. Before watching the movie, I thought that ""The Godfather"" would be about how great the authority of the Mafia under the Godfather would be, how violent and bloody it would be. After watching the movie, I deeply felt that my pattern was small. Unlike the gangster films I imagined, The Godfather opens with a beautiful family wedding, interspersed with the part where the original Godfather Vito receives the guests and helps them fulfill their wishes. I have to admire the acting of the actor playing the Godfather, who plays the two sides of the Godfather seamlessly, one is his compassionate side. The second is his cold authoritative side, the line ""an offer he can't refuse"" deeply imprinted in my mind. The opening wedding scene, as the most important part of the film, foreshadows the ending of the characters in many details, and the more you look back, the more you can feel the masterful director."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),narine_tevosyan,10,11 May 2019,"""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. It shows the closeness, the warmth of family ties. The scenes are filled with wives and squalling babies, festive weddings and equally festive funerals, spaghetti prepared in the kitchen. There is the flavor of Italian home life that few gangster films have attempted. This is one of the biggest advantages of this movie. I mean that generally in all gangster movies we see that the main characters tell that the family is the most valuable and crucial thing in the life, however we only hear it in these movie, we don't see. In ""The Godfather"" we see a great work, were every detail indicates the cohesion of Corleone's family.
A GREAT THANKS for the CAST. Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. These are the characters that will never die. I think that the actors that are chosen for these characters are the best ones. Al Pacino perfectly played his role; the way he changed from military to mafia. We see the this change in his play. Also the way how 47 years old Marlon Brando changed into such a believable senior citizen to play Vito Corelone. Yes, of course, first of all it is because of the makeup, however, his play also played a big role. Also, we all understand that is harder to play with this kind of a makeup and Brando achieved this. In my opinion, no one except him could play this character.
Director Francis Ford Coppola, with a strong assist from cameraman Gordon Willis, has done an extraordinary job of capturing period and place. Very few of the New York exteriors appear to be stock shots; most have been recreated with an incredible attention to detail. Interiors have the rich, burnt-umber look of photographs taken decades ago; while the exteriors - whether representing a garden party in New Jersey or an amorous interlude in Sicily - are filled with color and sun.
Another great plus of this movie is its soundracks choice. A ""Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis"" billboard in Vegas or ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" on the soundtrack (while a gangster dons his bulletproof vest) also add their own wry grace notes to the passing years."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jgcorrea,9,20 April 2021,"The producers have sworn for years that they never had any connection with the mafia, and that this film is entirely fictional. If it is, it is a culmination of imagination, and the source of many idioms, like Omertà, ""make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""Cosa Nostra"" and ""the Don"" (not Mr. Trump, BTW). It is the classic tale of the Corleone saga, and the war of the families in 1948. The best movie ever? I beg to kindly disagree."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BABS-Production-Limited,10,5 June 2020,The Godfather is a great movie with some iconic moments and delivery that will always be remembered globally
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scriptio,9,23 November 2020,"I watched that movie like I read a brilliant book. The plot (despite its simplicity) keeps your interest up all along. So, one should not be discouraged by its length."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spencergauldin,10,23 July 2020,"The Godfather is one of those timeless classics that will stand the test of time. It was during the time where there were more movies that had a run time of around 3 hours. Movies that run for 3 hours and after watching it makes it seem like half of that time did what they did right. This movie has timeless drama, tragedy, characters, story, revenge, dialogue, and moments that keeps it alive even almost 50 years later. This one should be on every movie buff's watchlist.
If you are a Breaking Bad fan, you need to thank this movie because a lot of inspiration for that show came from this movie. There are even moments that are directly taken from the movie that was brought to the show. I don't want to spoil it because that would take the experience out of it. Please watch this and Breaking Bad as well with Better Call Saul."

Marlon Brando delivers the best acting performance in movie history and Francis Ford Coppola directs brilliantly, no matter what Robert Evans or Paramount thought. I think Bob Evans should have shut his mouth during production of this film because he would have ruined its greatness had Coppola lost his will to direct under his constant complaining. Al Pacino delivers a slightly good performance, Jimmy Caan delivers a great performance along with Robert Duvall. Several quotes and scenes make the movie memorable and to this day, powerful. This is a must see for anyone. 20/10."

Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world that's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie."

Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lars_buodd_93,10,1 March 2014,"The story, the characters, the families and the acting. This is the greatest of all time indeed. How Michael goes from being the war hero non- criminal, to become the leader of the biggest crime family is just amazing. But the best thing about the movie is Marlon Brando's performance. Just astonishing and it will be remembered as one of the greatest acting performances in film. I love how the conflicts build up during the movie, and that they can not trust anyone except their own family. If you love mob and crime movies, this is one for you. The music is also terrific, it fits the scenes perfectly. It is a great directed movie by Francis Ford Coppola and he keeps up the impressing work in The Godfather Part 2. The first 2 months I watched this movie 6 times, and the number is still increasing. Can not get enough. 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ryan_ornob,10,20 September 2016,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),phattdirty,10,12 December 2005,"Hailed by almost every film critic as a masterpiece this film is regularly voted as #1 in film polls, or at very least in the top 10. And if there was ever a movie which deserved it's place amongst the elite, this is it. Director Francis Ford Coppola had only made low-budget movies and enjoyed limited success as a director up until 1970 when he came to recognition with his screenplay for Patton. The screenplay won himand co-writer Edmund H. North an Oscar. He then began work on a screenplay for The Godfather with Mario Puzo, the book's author. The resulting film took the world by storm and won Coppola his second Oscar for writing. The film also won Best Picture and Best Actor (Marlon Brando) at the 1973 Academy Awards and was nominated for 8 others Oscars including three nominations for Best Supporting Actor (James Caan, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall)."

There is not a single false step in the casting or the performances, and the movie has a lot to say about power, corruption, family, pride and America.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ochoamanuel21,10,7 February 2011,"Besides romanticizing the idea of being a mobster, the movie marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new idea. The whole concept is the patriarch of this mobster family seeing the end of a profit for innocent leisure activities such as gambling and running molasses when new mobsters want in on the narcotics business which is just dirty business since it involves addiction and not just plain drinking and gambling. The viewer sees how the old ideals of the 1920s which are embodied with the Don conflict with the new ideals of the 1950s which is the business of narcotics. It is an epic of the Don's youngest son, Michael, how he refuses the idea of being a part of the family and how his love for his father forces him to be more ruthless and calm than his father and his brother, since he takes action right away by killing Solozzo and the police captain for being corrupt and to top it off kills off the heads of the five families just to solidify the Corleone family power. This is the essential mobster movie since solidifies the idea of an organized crime effort with the Boss, the Underbosses who are next in line, the Capo Regime and the soldiers modeled after the Roman Empire as mentioned in Part II by Tom Hagen. While the sequel is arguably one of the best sequels of all time, the original excels in showcasing how this mobster empire conflicted with new ideals but came up on top with nothing but ruthlessness and calm precision by Michael."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),captaintacky,10,16 January 2022,"Perhaps no other film comes so close to perfectly depicting the lifestyle of the early mafia. It's flawless in it's execution, takes its time to let the story unfold properly, then builds the tension to maximum effect and allows the viewer to feel what that lifestyle must feel like when it all comes crashing down. So many amazing quotes, so many amazing images. Perhaps surpassed only by installment 2 (in this critic's eyes), there aren't many movies better made."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),garrettderose,8,11 August 2009,"Though I don't think The Godfather should be the #2 movie on the top 250, I understand it's importance to the industry. I understand that there's more depth in The Godfather than most movies of the time. I don't know, I keep a pretty open mind to movies and the different eras they were made in. 1970-1980 just isn't a popular decade for me. So far, The Godfather series is probably the best thing to come out of this era (or at least the first two). It's a pretty big hit. I loved it. I just didn't love it as much as the movie masses do even to this day. The story is rich, and Vito Corleone is easily one of my favorite characters of all time now. The death scenes are brutal and hard-hitting. The director didn't waste a single gunshot or strangulation for the sake of just doing it. There's a method to the madness of The Godfather, and I guess thats' why it hits people so hard. They story is built up in a way to where the killing of a character hits just as hard as your favorite character leaving the cast of your favorite sitcom."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ZoliTeglas,9,10 July 2018,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. It could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola's film of Mario Puzo's bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie. Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino)."

I thought this film was very good and it will always be top of the list for film lovers. The story is about Vito Corelone, who is nearing the end of his career as times are changing, and how the new generation wants to get in the business of more dangerous things then gambling, which is one of his main businesses. After a assassination attempt, Vito is forced to let his son Sonny take the reins and run the Corleone Family. But Sonny is a new Don, and instead of making the peace, his tempor makes him go to war. In the middle of all this, Michael, who Vito purposely trys to keep out of the family business gets directly involved. This is one that will forever live on in history as a great classic mob tale."

The movie can be seen on many levels, with equal satisfaction awaiting those who just want a good story, and those who require much more. The Godfather is long, yes - but that's a hundred and seventy minutes well spent. When the closing credits run, only part of the story was told. However, this last haunting image (the shock of the recognition of Kay), coupled to the sad score of Nino Rota, leaves an impression of crater that The Godfather Part II only deepens."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ash-10692,10,10 July 2006,I thought i might as well watch this film as it is hailed as one of the best films ever. The film lived up to all my expectations and it is truly amazing.The film is about the Corleone family's crime rings in the mid 40s-50s. It shows the families descent into more and more serious crime. The number of quotable lines is massive just showing how cool it is as well. Once your hooked on the film you wont look away and wont leave your seat once. The acting by Marlon Brando is so convincing that you could believe he really was a mafia don. The film is said to be violent but to be honest there is little violence in it and the violence is very mild. This is a good thing though because if it was too violent it wood spoil the film.

I would give it a '10' but I find the length drags it down a little. Other than that deserving of belonging in the Top 250 films. However, I would not give it #1. I would have to reserver that honor for Sergio Leone's ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"". ""The Godfather"" did give us some awesome performances, one of the only Brando roles I truly enjoyed. As well my 2nd favorite Coppola film (1st being ""The Conversation"").I think it's worth repeat viewing, and a definite keeper in a movie lover's collection. Bottom line a solid '8', with a desire to see it again soon."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),meetsadhu-28235,3,23 January 2023,"However, the story line of The Godfather Part I has many flaws: 1-: Why should Don Corleone, supposedly a very clever and intelligent man, send Luca Brasso, the paladin of his court, as an intelligence agent posing as a turncoat into to the enemy camp and expect anyone in that enemy camp to believe it? Obviously they didn't and conspired to have him killed. Anyone, including the Godfather's enemies knew of Luca Brasso's absolute devotion to the Godfather and would have laughed and never believed such an amateurish ruse, that the Godfather's most loyal enforcer has suddenly become a turncoat. 2-: Why should Sollozzo assume that by killing the Godfather he can make a deal with his temperamental son, Sonny? And with a son of a Sicilian mafia family at that!! 3-: Why, at the midst of the war between the Godfather's family and other new York mafia families, when every member of the Godfather's family, for their protection, is brought into the family compound where the family is residing, Constance, the Godfather's daughter (who was pregnant at the time) and her husband (an active member of the mafia side of the family) were allowed to live elsewhere (seemingly at a far away location and apparently in an adjoining state) which would have clearly placed them in harm's way and in extreme danger (at the midst of a war being raged against the Godfather's family)? Unfortunately, these were all story contrivances included in the story-line merely in order to set up dramatic scenes following the above mentioned obvious and unexplained acts of negligence."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),artanavdiu,8,9 November 2014,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it.

There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aviatormoneygame,10,12 October 2023,"The film delves into the multifaceted world of the Corleone family, a mafia clan that navigates through the tumultuous waters of crime, power, and familial obligation. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is both intimidating and deeply human, crafting a character whose quiet, composed demeanor belies an undercurrent of ferocity and sagacity."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bensagalmorris-65193,10,10 August 2019,"The Godfather is a cultural landmark. More than being just a film, it manages to tell a story of an American family in the post-war era. This family just happens to be different from most. What makes the film such a monumental triumph is how it manages to be a massive popular success while also being an undeniable artistic triumph. The cast is one of the greatest in the history of the medium. Brando delivers a performance of quiet enormity. His sidelong glances and hand gestures do just as much talking as his dialogue. Pacino is so perfectly cast as Michael Corleone that one is amazed to find out how many doubted him for the role. James Caan has never been better as Sonny Corleone. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are also perfect in their roles as well. Coppola's direction is magistral. The wedding sequence combined with Vito answering favors in his office is a brilliant piece of work. All of the principal characters are introduced, and exposition is delivered in such a subtle fashion that you might not realize it's happening. We instantly find out all of the necessary character information of these people and it's done in a way that makes it all seem effortless. The film's major sequences are so well done, they are seared into our collective consciousness. The restaurant hit by Michael, the horse's head in the bed, the Sicily sequence, the assassination of Sonny, and the Baptism massacre are all handled in a way that makes them feel like an odd mix of dark slices of Norman Rockwell nostalgia and Catholic mythology. The pioneering cinematography by Gordon Willis turned every form of lighting into a thematic weapon. The darks are so dark, and the rest of the color pallet has a glow that, again, seems to make the film look like Norman Rockwell, or old photographs, adding to the nostalgia. The music is some of the finest ever composed for a motion picture, and I get goosebumps whenever I hear it. The editing is a marvel, look at the previously mentioned Baptism massacre for some of the best in history. In short, The Godfather is a masterpiece on every level and this is only the surface, one can dig much deeper into the film, and you'll find a story of America itself. But, that is beyond the scope of this review. I'll just say, if you somehow haven't seen this artistic milestone, get on it, and witness the start of the greatest saga (at least for the first 2 films) in American cinematic history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),superboy478,10,2 June 2002,"From Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather, to me, was the movie of the 20th century. It had the perfect cast, screenplay, story, characters, set design, ect. It deserved every single Oscar that it was nominated for. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),celebrityscenenewsdesk,10,22 May 2018,"Marlon Brando, certainly one of the greatest actors of our time was magnificent as The Godfather. No one including Damian Chapa, who I produced ""Brando Unauthorized,"" for could quite portray this actor. This is why I rate ""The Godfather a 10. The filming in New York was located in parts of Little Italy, of which had to be approved by the bosses. Paramount at that time reluctantly went along with this project, and in the end results was a box office hit."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),leoarias588,5,9 July 2013,"this movie has action its an okay movie, on the count of a few actors but most of the actors are good play rollers who take there part and do what they got to do. mean while others do not and just don't care that much. this movie had a lot of enthusiasm, action, adventure, and its based on an old time mafia gang. which is practically why so many people rate so high. its an amazing story based on 5 tribes who want power over the whole city. there is a wise tribe, aggressive tribe, smart tribe, poor tribe, and a rich tribe. these five families have different ways of surviving and gaining trust over the other 4.due to an overwhelm of one taking to much land it causes trouble. so that's when the action begins to happen. so i would highly recommend this movie to all who want to watch it or just want to know what its about."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tamerhaddou-70008,10,26 June 2021,"Coppola's immortal cinematic masterpiece in the history of cinema, the greatest cinematic film, has an impact in the world of films. The greatest director in the history of cinema and the greatest acting. Marlon Brando, the godfather of world cinema, has played a great role in the history of cinema 10/10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mc-clean,10,12 July 2006,"This definitely deserves to be the top film in the IMDb.com 250 best films. It has so many memorable scenes which will live in the memory of those who see this film for ever. Scenes such as the wedding at the beginning, the shooting of the Don, the death of Sonny, Michael outside the hospital and when he's in the restaurant when he kills Sollozzo, the death of Vito in the garden and perhaps the best of all, the eventual hand over when Clamenza kisses Michael's hand and says ""Don Corleone"".Marlon Brando puts in a career defining performance in his portrayal of Don Vito Corleone. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant with Al Pacino showing that his casting for the role of Michael Corleone was inspired. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and James Caan as Sonny Corleone also deserve mention. The Cinematography is sensational as is the direction by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is even followed up by a sequel that all but matches this film in its brilliance. Quite simply the greatest film ever made!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Marios345,10,11 August 2022,"Well, after all these years and this movie remains a masterpiece. What can i say, the acting performances (especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino), the script, and the director's work, all were perfect. It's one of the few movies that they can describe as life-changing. But the reason i rated it as 9/10 is because of the time, this movie was perfect but too long."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sorinraducozma,10,12 June 2016,"This movie is chock full of stellar performances, beautiful shots, and a compelling family saga. If it is too long (it is), a little slow in places (it is) and somewhat hard to follow in certain places (yep) we can forgive it, because they just don't make movies like this anymore. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sobhanjavi,9,27 June 2020,This movie is one of my best. it add to my life some kind of classification
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),director03,8,11 October 2001,"Although I would not consider it the greatest movie ever, I would still give the Godfather a 10/10 and am willing to say that it is quite an amazing film. It is emotional, involving, and the performances are top-notch. A film that is good in every category, The Godfather is definitely better than it's sequels and my second favorite Coppola film (I liked Apocalypse Now a bit more)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BK8Asia,10,9 September 2020,"Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as an insightful, tough elderly person, really has the character lead in the film; Al Pacino, with a splendidly evolved presentation as Michael, is the lead. In any case, Brando's exhibition is a dexterous expendable, despite the fact that it earned him an Academy Award for best entertainer."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Enfatss,10,17 July 2023,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gianlfiecconi,9,14 November 2016,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Hesly_,10,8 January 2024,"I watched this masterpiece only a couple of months ago and of course with a lot of expectations, im not really a guy who seen a lot of movies but from the start i knew i was watching one of the best movie ever made. The story goes really fluid and all the characters are insanely good written, i really liked from the start Michael, and Vito. Overall the film goes really fluid and even tho i prefer the second film of the trilogy i cant hate this one, and i really think that this is a masterpiece that everybody needs to watch at least one time in life.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emad9109,10,5 September 2023,"Marlon Brando plays a strange role in The Godfather. It seems that after several decades of acting and, of course, more importantly, living in his own unique way, he has reached a certain result; A philosophy that we also see in numerous videos of his interviews. In response to the question of how he became a great actor, Brando always answered that his whole life was acting and he had to act for everyone. Maybe this way of commenting is also a gesture; But I think that this is the factor of his self-confidence, no matter how much he has come to believe this. In my opinion, acting is related to all body movements, but all these techniques end with the eyes."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RicardoFelicianoMorbeck,10,3 December 2018,The godfather is for me the best movie of all. Al Pacino's performance is impeccable. The direction of Francis Ford Coppola shows what a great director he is. A masterpiece.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kdcapel,10,9 March 2024,"Here's a movie that's as old as I am. No matter how many times I watch this, there are some parts I'll keep repeating over and over. Especially the assassination of Sonny Corleone (James Caan) on the causeway. As for the rest of the movie, it's VERY good. And Marlon Brando is perfect as Don Vito Corleone. And later on, when Michael Corleone becomes the new Don of the Corleone family, he finds out who the traitor is to the family, when he becomes the Don. Then eliminates the heads of the five families on Connie's baby's baptism. And Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen knows when to issue an informative advice to the family."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TeaRoomFort,10,11 April 2024,"The performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the Corleone family. His nuanced portrayal of a man who is ruthless in business but deeply caring towards his family is truly remarkable. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, the reluctant son who is drawn into the family business. His transformation from an innocent outsider to a ruthless leader is both chilling and captivating."

Of course I've heard of it, seen clips, told of it's brilliance, but nothing could have prepared me for this movie. ""Fantastic"" is the word. The actors are amazing - every one of them. You love, you hate, you cry. No emotion is left untouched. I don't think I need to write any further. The plot, the characters etc. have been described over and over, and all I have yet to do is give my strongest recommendation. If you are a girl like myself you will for certain fall deeply in love with the human, but dangerous young Al Pacino (and he is drop dead gorgeous too!)"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thabisobuchulewalker,10,31 December 2023,"Aptly the godfather of gangster shows and movies, the original 1972 release is still the best Godfather movie. The movie won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Marlon Brando.don't have too much to say about it, but GOD DAMN THAT MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! Going into it, my expectations were cautious because of how hyped it is. I know it is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and with how long it is I expected at least a little bit of dragged out plot or slowness, but every single moment was riveting. This movie is absolutely the best I've ever seen in regards to knowing when and how to present the story. It reserves itself and only gets brutal/intense when necessary, and even the most simple and quiet of scenes have an immense sense of meaning to them. My heart pounded harder than it EVER has in a movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RLMC,10,12 December 1999,"It is the best film I have seen to date. It is flawless in every way, acting, story, cinematography, direction, etc. I have seen Citizen Kane, but I must say, this one beats it. I can wait until it comes out on DVD. You know when a film is great, that is when no matter how many times you have seen it, if you happen to catch it on TV, you still watch it and are glued to your TV set, this is that film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salehb-79128,9,2 June 2023,"The Godfather, released in 1972, stands as an undisputed classic in the realm of cinema, a mesmerizing portrayal of power, family, and the dark underbelly of organized crime. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's acclaimed novel, this cinematic masterpiece continues to captivate audiences and remains a benchmark for storytelling excellence."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),the don-15,10,12 November 2000,"The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made and it is one of the few movies that doesn't have a single flaw in it. The direction in the Godfather is superb and he acting in the movie is excellent, Marlon Brando gives us one of his best performances. Frances Ford Coppola makes the movie focus more on the family than on anything else and is much more than a gangster movie, it is more about family. The Movie is a film noir perfect in every way. 10 OUT OF 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hugemovieman,4,3 November 2023,"I like the mafia in this movie, very creative and the action is cool even if it is sparce. Where this movie faulters is its cinemifotgraphy and writing i think its badly written espically the comedic parts, obviously it was a rushed film and compared to other movie its bad. Espically compared to ferris buelrs big day off a cinematic masterpiece and great film, the writing ci emafotography and other componenets were great espically when considering its low budget overall ferris bulers big day off is one of the best movies of all time and id reccomend to anyone espically over this ""godfather"" movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rubenmaria-soriquez,10,9 January 2022,"A stellar cast for a timeless, brilliant and spectacular classic film. A milestone set in the history of cinema by three big names: Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The best Mob film ever made, pioneering in many aspects: camera movements and shots, poetry of light, actor's work in pauses full of meaning and tension. The work of production designer Dean Tavoularis and costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone were very meticulous and truthful and created that impact of truthfulness that served as an indispensable support in the unraveling of the intertwining of a terrible and shocking but tender at the same time story, always exciting. A film that gives you something more at every new vision."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benjajamim,10,10 January 2006,"Elegant crime and respected Italian leaders is the best setting for a Mafia. The Godfather is truly a great movie. When I saw it I felt identified even though I have nothing to do with any mafia. The main point of this film is how Michael Corleone inherits the work of his father, Vito Corleone. This movie touched my emotions. It is greatly directed by my friend the great Francis Ford Copolla, greatly written by my dearest Mario Puzzo and PERFECTLY ACTED by my masters Marlo Brando and Al Pacino. It is not by coincidence that this is ranked Top 1 in the IMDb list. The character of MArlo Brando is the perfect character a film like this should have: an old wise man who knows whats good and bad for his business, who even though leads a huge criminal bloody almost gore mafia, has a soul of his own that manages to love his family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jicx_ukey,9,1 December 2019,When I see the scenes on this film. Its always expressing something...
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sonnychambers-45712,1,23 April 2024,"In the annals of cinema, there are bold reimaginings, and then there's the travesty that is ""The Godfather"" With Tom Cruise cast in every role, this adaptation plunges headfirst into the abyss of cinematic catastrophe, leaving behind any semblance of respect for the source material or the craft of acting. Directorial incompetence collides with Cruise's ego-driven spectacle, resulting in a cinematic catastrophe of epic proportions."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karladavisio,10,3 April 2020,"If they ask me which films will remain forever excellent, ""The Godfather"" will be one of the first in this category. Filmed after the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, released in 1969, this film burst into all the lists of the best films and is now considered the best picture of the mafia. Director Francis Ford Coppola got the idea to make a film after reading the book. The film company Paramount Pictures regarded the project as a small gangster drama and did not expect much success. But when Puzo's novel suddenly became a bestseller, the stakes on picture quality rose sharply. And although the studio did not dare to fire Coppola in the middle of filming, fearing for their product, they tried to insert their five cents. In particular, they demanded that Marlon Brando not be involved in the process and that Al Pacino be dismissed.
The plot tells the story of a gangster clan where the old but influential don Vito Corleone runs the show. He has a beloved family, things are going well, everyone respects you - in a word, he rolls around like cheese in olive oil. But suddenly, an attempt is made on Don Corleone, and, as it was unexpected, a couple of days after the deal that would help another criminal clan, but Vito fundamentally refused it. And at a tense moment, Michael decides to solve family affairs and manage his father's empire - Don Vito's beloved son and a man who wanted to abstract as much as possible from the mafia but had to take the reins of government into his own hands.
There is a legend that after the premiere of the film, the director was called by the real gangsters in order to ... scatter in thanks. Coppola showed the world shown in Puzo's novel in as much detail as possible and showed the mafia bosses, ordinary people, with feelings. Speaking about the cast, no other word other than ""Beauty"" does not arise. Rejected the Oscar, Marlon Brando is a very talented actor. He makes him believe that his character has power comparable to the head of state but at the same time an honest, loving, caring family man.
Michael Corleone is a character no less interesting than Don Vito himself. The hero has suffered many trials, as a result of which he changes and makes serious decisions. And behind such a strong character an actor should have stood, no less talented than Brando. 32-year-old Al Pacino is a year younger than the director, rocked Hollywood with his performance. I know that I praise this great actor enough, but it was The Godfather that became the starting point of his fame.
When I hear that the film was shot from a book, I cross my fingers so that the creators do not lose the quality of the picture. But there is nothing to be afraid of since the plot canvas is carefully transferred to the screen. The Godfather is not so much a gangster drama as a story about love, family, power, and betrayal."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Eltaigeer,9,12 January 2021,No words.. Just the best movie ever.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ajinthomas-38977,8,11 October 2019,"The thing which forced me to watch Godfather was it's rating and honestly speaking it's a good film. In this review I will be speaking about the good and the bad things about the film.
Good things :-
1) Acting - Vito Corleone's acting is a thing of beauty and it is so good that you will never be bored seeing him on screen. Other actors have also done a fabulous work and the acting department is actually very much advanced and strong.
2) Dialogues - Dialogue used are just perfect there's a time when you become a fan of the dialogues and dialogue delivery. And mark my word after the film you will say ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""
3) Storyline - The best thing about Godfather is his storyline. Even after being an almost 3 hour long film, the film has so many unpredictable twist and turns that keeps you guessing what's next."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),strukovanataliia,10,19 January 2022,"The film ""The Godfather"" - watched several times, because it is an amazing film, one of my favorites! The film has a very good cast - Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are great, strong actors. All the actors in this film did their part brilliantly! The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a genius. The music in the film is wonderful, the script is excellent, the film is a masterpiece! This is a movie that everyone should watch at least once. Although the film is about the mafia, about crime, it is still based on human relationships, the lives of people who make mistakes, need help and support in difficult times, about friendship and betrayal. Although the film is long, it consists of three parts, but it looks with great interest, because there are no extra scenes in the film, every moment is interesting! A wonderful family drama, with the cruel rules of the mafia of life, and with an excellent cast! The best, successful film in the cinema about the mafia."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),huskiegaming,10,4 July 2020,"I love everything about this movie. The actors, the plot, and the cinematography."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nadavikt,10,30 December 2014,"The Film ""The Godfather"" Is Without Doubt The Best Film I Have Ever Seen, The Direction Is Perfect And The Acting Is Unbeatable. The Godfather Is A Long Film So If You Cant Watch A Movie For 2:57 Hours Then Skip This Film Even Though You Should Not. WARNING This Review Contains SPOILERS For ""The GodFather"" So If You Don't Want Spoilers For The Godfather Leave Now You've Been Warned, And The Godfather Is A Violent Movie So If Your Not 12+ Leave Now. Lets Begin, The Film The Godfather Starts In The Wedding Of The Daughter Of Vito Or Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) Were Not So Much Violence Happens But Mainly Presents The Cast. I Wont Lie The First 0:43 Minuets Of The Film Were Not As Good As The 2:14 Hours To Follow But A Major Plot Point Comes In That Time So Its Important. The First Half Of The Film is About The Corleone's Regular Days, But All That Changes When SPOILER ALERT: Don Corleone Is Nearly Killed From Another Mafia Who Already Killed An Other Character Luca Brasi Which Changes Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) From A Good Man To The Mafia Man He Never Wanted To Become. After Michael And His Brothers Fredo And Sonny Take Charge Over The Family Until They're Dad Comes Back, They Have A Meal With A Police Officer Who Broke Michaels Jaw, Michael Shoots The Cop And His Bodyguard What Causes The Second Half Of The Film When Michael Must Fly To Italy And He Stays There For Two Years Which All Contain Him Falling In Love, Getting Marred, Finding Out His Brother Sonny Was Killed, Wanting To Go Back To New York And Having His Wife Be Killed By One Of His Bodyguards. After Michaels Wife Is Killed He Returns To New York There He Meets His Ex Girlfriend Katherine (Diane Keaton) Who He Ends Up Marring And Having A Child With. There Is A Part In The Film Were You See Don Corleone Back On His Feet Talking To Michael And That For Me Is Were His Acting As The Don Really Shins And That Is Were His Character Really Connected To Me And Made Him One Of The Best Characters Of All Time For Me. One Of The Saddest Parts In The Film Is Around The End And Huge SPOILER ALERT Here This Is Big: In A Scene You See Don Corleone And Michaels Son Playing Around The Garden When All Of A Sudden Don Corleone Falls To The Ground And Dies And In That Scene You Can Really Feel The Sadness And Are Even More Sad When Michaels Son Keeps Spraying Don With Water And Dose Not Know His Dead. There Are Few Scenes That Thrilled Me As Much As The Baptising Scene In ""The Godfather"" Were You See Michael And His Wife Come To The Church To Become The Godparents Of Constanzia The Daughters Son And In That Scene You Can Also See Michaels First Acts As Leader Of The Corleone Family Which Includes Killing Of The Leader Of The Mafia Who Tried To Kill His Dad And More Stuff Of That Type An Is Just Incredible And Amazing. This Film Is Full Of Amazing Action And Intense Scenes Full Of Nail Biting Moments I Would Highly Suggest You Watch It If You Haven't Already And I Give It An: A+ Or A: 100/100 Or A: 11/10 Because Its That Good!."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joederosa16,9,21 July 2019,"This film is a masterpiece. The acting is as good or better that any other film in history. Script is beautiful written. Almost every component of this film is on par with being the best film of all time.
The only aspect I disliked is the time. This film is almost 3 hours. It truly becomes a choir near the end to finish it but it is well worth your time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karimnn,2,16 August 2022,"I watched this film when I was a kid, then as a teenager, then twice as an adult. I watch a lot of classic films, foreign and domestic (US), and I am very open minded in my movie selection. Apart from the music score and somber and tragic mood in the film, I find tp be it very unappealing. The cinematography is wonderful, no doubt, but the story telling, script, and acting as mediocre. Marlon Brando's acting has always been overrated, I always heard Marlon Brando, this, Marlon Brando that, I saw 5 of his films and I never watched others. HE's got to be one of the worst actors that ever set foot on a set. Al Pacino acts like he is running on a 2 volt battery in this movie, and they're supposed to be Italians right? Mafia or otherwise Italians do not behave as they do in this movie, and this causes the film to lose credibility. Al Pacino is an amazing actor, my favorite, but in this movie he is mediocre. The Godfather is a great story but the film fails to glue me to the TV. Huge cast, wonderful music and cinematography, what a waste of talent."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ptybdjgamer,9,28 April 2013,"I've tried to watch through this movie so many times without succeeding, and the reason to that is that the movie is incredibly boring. I know this is a very respected movie and considered one of the greatest movies ever, according to some the best movie ever. But I don't really see what's so great about it, the movie starts off boring and ends boring. I seriously cannot understand how anyone could watch through 3 hours of this crap. The movie is way to detailed, half of the stuff in the movie you don't even need to know, the acting was good and I give the storyline a meh. What ruined it all was the length and combining that with the movies boredom ruins it all. I have watched many movies, and I am a movie enthusiast, but this one does not even reach my top 50. Other movies like Stand By Me and The Green Mile etc are way better than The Godfather. Don't waste your time on this movie, its three hours of boredom. Watch Shawshank Redemption or Titanic instead. Even 8 Mile ranks higher than this on my top list. It is up to you, you can either give the movie a go, or just waste your time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sabielchicagoautoshowpod,10,25 December 2023,1000% best movies ever. I love it and the movie was great too. Great movie too watch every movie with your friends. I hope they like it too much for them. They are so much better than the other guys I met on the show and they are very good people to work with on their show. They have been very good friends with me in my past few months and I think they have been really helpful and helpful and helpful and I think that they are very supportive people and I think will be many more years to come and games for us to see and to learn from each other as well as to see each other and to see how we can do things in.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),j-97569,9,17 March 2020,"When I saw this movie ten years ago, I couldn't understand it.And now I think it's the best movie I ever seen. Marlon Brando is the real man."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mored4u,8,23 September 2013,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gcbeaton-87178,10,7 January 2023,Yesterday gave up another couple hours from my time deciding that I was going to rewatch the godfather. Last time my mistake I was on my phone. So I thought the The movie was confusing boring. But after I rewatched this it was insane. The plot is amazing it's it's so good Show Invested for 3 hours. The fact that it was the person getting married at the start who killed the brother was insane. The screenplay of this movie was insane the way it was written I think this has gotta be one of my favorite movies. I think that it's gonna be hard to top. And the fact that Michael At the start didn't want to be involved in the mafia and then laid on he decides I'm going to get this a shot in And he makes some bold moves and I definitely think hes seen it turn on the family I eventually could stay triumphant on him. Now I took it from my favorite part of the film he acting from al pachino It's sorted good and When I looked at the godfather part Too I saw a al pachino. So I definitely think it's one of my favourites.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ilhano,10,1 July 2015,"Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" or ""don,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family ""business."""

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ressoapk,9,8 March 2023,"It's past 1pm and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. I should probably go to bed. It's already late and I have to get up a little early tomorrow. But not enough to put off writing these lines. Now that I've seen it three times, the chance to share my thoughts and new insights is too good an offer to sit around. Please wait."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Empifilmes,10,20 August 2022,"I have to admit, I was nervous going to this movie, what would it be if I didn't realize the quality and aspects that make this film one of the best productions ever? Turns out , I was immediately fascinated by how the slow and deadly pace and the calm and smooth interpretations contributed to the tension present throughout the story (an interesting contrast indeed)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lafayettephotographer,10,28 April 2019,"The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),phoenix_tear,10,18 January 2004,"The Godfather was the first movie I ever saw that Al Pacino was in. I was glued to the TV the first time I saw it (of course I was, who wouldn't be?). Now Al Pacino is my favorite actor. The Godfather is one of my favorite movies of all time!! Not only that, it is one of the greatest movies of all time!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),satya-kiran,10,9 September 2014,"This movie is strong and good scripted, great acting by the lead cast.It is hard to find a movie done this well in recent times. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business, and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alexandreperes-96669,10,29 July 2022,"My father and i have the habit of watching some mafia movies one in a while but i've never seen this movie. Here i am, after watching this three hour mind-blowing experience. A great film, as all of them should be. Amazing characters and inner conflicts. Amazing story. Amazing movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),irfan_baig,10,2 July 2002,"Francis Ford Coppolla has indeed done an excellent job of illustrating an Italian mafia family in the US, all the extremes they go through etc. The casting was also excellent and Marlon Brando/Al Pacino undoubtedly deserved the Oscars. The picturization was also well done, along with the background music. If you have read the book by Mario Puzzo, you will surely notice some change in the story towards the end. I suppose the change was to enable the production of Godfather II and III, which wereZ also good."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),groppernejat,10,5 January 2024,"The Godfather"" (1972) is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history and a classic in the crime genre. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the story of the Corleone crime family and their patriarch, Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grcsheyla,10,17 September 2018,"I mean I expected this movie to make me bored within the first 20 minutes but instead it was great and I loved how the story line always kinda kept you guessing and always seemed to keep going and never seemed to end, but obviously in a good way because it kept me on the edge of my seat."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),StephanieGould,10,26 December 2002,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time. The performances from all the actors are on target. I have to say though, that I am one of those fans who has to put The Godfather I and the Godfather II on the same plate. They are equally my favorites and they are equally done to the same degree. Although II has its perks with DeNiro speaking Italian for most of the film. It's great. Memorable moments in the first one though are the entire film. Rarely does a movie come along where the entire film is memorable. Even the small scenes. I can truely say I love it. I never get tired of it. As a Italian-American growing up w/parents and relatives who memorized the movies, it is great to finally acknowledge them and say that Godfather is the best!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),acsonbarreto,10,25 December 2017,"I love this movie. The continuation is also excellent. Michael was a good successor to the Corleone family, but one of his biggest problems was at home: Kay. If Apollonia was alive to the end, it would be different."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pusechabana,10,31 December 2023,"From the very opening scenes to the final, breathtaking moments, this trilogy of movies has left an indelible mark on my cinematic experience. Spanning over three hours in each installment, this trilogy is a mesmerizing journey through the rise of a mafia boss and his evolution, making it an absolute must-see for any film enthusiast."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alma_2028,10,28 November 2021,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said before? Simply the Godfather, a movie that everyone should see sometime in their lives. I am young and I love it, highly recommended."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),groppernejat,10,5 January 2024,"Compelling Story and Screenplay: Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola, crafted a compelling narrative that explores themes of power, family, and the consequences of a life immersed in organized crime. The story spans several decades, providing a comprehensive look at the characters' lives and the evolution of the Corleone family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rafiul_Alam_Bipu,3,1 July 2021,"Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jasemine80,10,15 January 2004,"well, after watching the trio for the first time , I could have figured out that I was living with a lack of understanding the human nature before. cruelty is coming from our very nature as well as the feeling of love, belonging, disloyalty and helplessness..we are the same mixture of those living in different shapes and names..It's impossible to divide ourselves from those elements and, whoever we are, this is the film of understanding that, power and wealth is only the carriage to us, can not be the aim itself..and also, happiness is always a prisoner of real life tragedies because of ýt's good nature..ýf human is in the way of managing those tragedies in stead of obeying them, impossible to get out from facing the harder ones..and the best is managing our own desires.. godfather is like a whole life for me, and it's a u turn in my life.I just can't understand that a human could write down it and another one put it on screen.. yasemin"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),clifford-82579,10,13 October 2018,"I was first introduced to The Godfather during the summer of 2017. I had expected an action packed, lighthearted flick, but received something much more unforgettable. Although the plot is somewhat convoluted, the messages of the American Dream and freedom are shown clearly. In the film, The Godfather, the director, Francis Ford Coppola, brings the movie alive and makes the movie memorable through visual aids, symbols, and music. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yumargagat19,9,2 November 2014,"This movie was outstanding for me, because this brilliant idea from mario puzzo and great performance all actor make many people's believe that on that year (which movie set take), the situation looks very real happened in US in general."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),garvaag,10,22 April 2006,"It has the best elements from about every movie-genres. Some of the scenes are breath-taking. This was the first time I watched The Godfather even though I had the trilogy-box for months. My expectations was very high, so I've been waiting for the right time to watch. Today was the day. The Godfather overcame my expectations!! I will watch this movie one more time before moving to Part Two and Three. The Godfather need full attention. You can't watch a movie like this one on Saturday-evening with the kids running around the house and the wife vacuum'ing. This movie needs the right setting and you to be ready and in the right mood for one of the greatest movie-experiences. And I really mean it!! JG"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amino-30448,9,21 July 2021,This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),richardmartello,5,6 February 2018,"Great movie, i loved the writing involved showing how what happens in Italian families."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gogi_chomakhashvili,10,6 January 2023,"The Godfather is a timeless classic that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. The movie, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, tells the story of the powerful and feared Italian-American organized crime family, the Corleones, as they navigate the dangerous world of the mafia."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),crossfitdcne,9,9 April 2024,"The Godfather stands as a monumental achievement in cinema, meriting a resounding 9 out of 10 stars. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this masterpiece effortlessly combines intense drama with a detailed, poignant exploration of family, power, and morality within the Italian-American mafia. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is nothing short of legendary, offering a character of immense depth and complexity, while Al Pacino's transformative journey as Michael Corleone is a compelling narrative of innocence lost. The film's narrative is both grandiose and intimate, weaving a tale that is as much about the bonds of family as it is about the business of crime. Coppola's direction is meticulous, creating a film that feels both timeless and deeply rooted in its 1940s and 1950s settings. The cinematography is stunning, with Gordon Willis's use of light and shadow contributing to an atmosphere that is both foreboding and inviting. Nino Rota's score further enriches the cinematic experience, embedding itself in the viewer's memory. ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's an indelible part of cultural history, a saga that resonates as strongly today as it did upon its release. A true classic in every sense of the word."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kalyanbhuniaworkpersonal,10,15 May 2023,Must watch . A masterpiece . Love to watch this.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adriancampos-95424,10,12 July 2020,"From Freddo, to Vito and Michael, the acting in this movie is too good, you forget you're watching one. Every single character in this movie is an icon. The score is also great and sets a very chilling atmosphere. The experience from watching this movie is like none other. It is very engaging and I can easily say it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Yes. I say film now because it sounds more passionate than movie. If you haven't seen this film don't wait. This and Part 2 will be one of your all time favorites. Part 2 is boring if you haven't seen Part 1 (I made that mistake because of my college film professor). But once you watch part 1, Part 2 is equally good and both are top 5 films of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Manish_Chaudhary,10,8 May 2022,"Till now The Godfather Movies counts in best movies. Really Awesome. When First time time watched it, just hooked with story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xuefeiding,9,4 May 2020,"The film tells the story of how Michael, the youngest son of Godfather Don Corleone, became the new godfather, and portrays the fictional New York Mafia in the novel as a family struggle to realize the American dream. This film has been upgraded from a police and bandit story to an epic about the pursuit of rights and the use of power, officially opening the era of ""New Hollywood"" of Oscar, and expanding the types of gangster crime films, which has a far-reaching impact on many classic gangster films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hussainmd-aslam,10,22 October 2018,"This movie certainly does not need a review for sure. Commanding performance of entire cast, all dialogues are already written in silver line, epic scenes and marvellous acting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, brilliant direction."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mauligathafilms,9,26 August 2022,"He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pusechabana,10,31 December 2023,"Title: ""The Epic Journey of Power and Redemption: A Trilogy Worth Every Minute"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),timofeizam,10,19 January 2022,"First of all, The Godfather laid the foundation for what real movie gangsters should look like: respectable, but at the same time cruel people who only care about themselves, their family and their subordinates. This type, more or less, was followed by all subsequent creators: someone, without taking a step to the side, someone tried to move away from the formed image as much as possible, and someone making a great number of references to it, and sometimes repeating frame by frame. However, all subsequent films of the gangster genre have been created with an eye on The Godfather and tried to reach or even surpass its level (which, in the end, the sequel did two years later)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),D.C.-2,10,24 June 2000,"I have to say this film comes as close to perfect as any film in modern history. It is just brilliant filmmaking from top to bottom. The film boasts the greatest cast EVER assembled. Marlon Brando(Vito) gives one of the most captivating performances ever seen. Al Pacino(Michael) is just fabulous and mesmerizing to watch. His transformation from beginning to end was movie magic. Robert Duvall(Tom) was superb as always as the surrogate son. And James Caan(Satino) is just perfect in the film and gives life to perhaps my favorite ""character"" in all of films. He just lits up the screen everytime he's on it. And seeing Andy Garcia as his equally hot tempered son in Part III was a joy. The rest of the cast is flawless. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said already. The greatest trilogy ever is without question The Godfather Trilogy. And this was the original. 10/10"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dethburger,10,29 May 2001,"I can't say enough about this film. It is simply the best example of what can be achieved through the art of cinema. It's visually stunning, literate and totally engrossing. It gave us the finest Pacino performance of his career, no small feat. And gave us Brando unlike I've ever seen him before. You can't take your eyes off him. His performance is stunning. Every other role is also perfectly cast. Look for James Caan to ignite the screen. I watch this film at least once a year so I can remember what a first rate film is supposed to be like."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Cruel_Intentions,9,8 October 2004,"I'm a bit different than most 14 year old guys that love 2 fast 2 furious. My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption and I love watching classics. Anyway, after numerous people telling me that they would literally kick my ass unless i saw this movien and the rest, I decided to do it. I've yet to watch Part II & III. Anyway, I really liked this movie. The acting was superb by all, and there's no need to beat a dead horse (pun intended:P) by saying that Pacino and Brando are unbelievable. Although I didn't LOVE it as incredibly much as some people, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't wait to see the next two parts."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),subham-91185,10,27 November 2021,"The masterpiece can be awarded the greatest creation of the 70s. The movie which is the reflection of the mesmerizing collection of Mario Puzo's trilogy. It has aptly presented the Italian refugee community at that time fighting for their existence and identity in America and the real darkness of the 'Cosa Nostra'. Other than that it also shows what a man can do to protect his family. The desperate measure, the fearlessness and the bold characters can be truly inspiring. The ambience it creates cannot be expressed in words."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pratikpontirtha,10,25 June 2017,"It was very good.At the beginning it seems to be passion of heart and later transfigures into a drama Alfred Hitchcock tried to establish. Suspense and excitement, the old film noir and modern crime.Representing a journey that you will never forget. Mario puzos novel was greatly applied by Brando,Pacino and the whole cast.Likedit sincerely.Motivated me to be a film lover."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Raflindia,10,4 March 2024,"This movie will be always the number 1. The Godfather is the best movie ever made. Great Francis Ford Coppola, great Al Pacino, amazing Marlon Brando. The other 2 movies are amazing but the first is the first. Always. Also the history of the movie, the production, post production. The issues, gossip around it, the struggles. Everything makes this movie a piece of history into the movie industry."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),muazashraf98,10,5 September 2014,The Godfather has all the qualities of a great film. Everything in it is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola has done a marvelous job in directing. The cast is superb especially the Oscar-winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacino's acting is phenomenal. It has the many of the greatest movie quotes of all time. It shows the humane side of Mafia and depicts it so beautifully that we are absorbed by it. It has immortalized Mario Puzo's novel. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is also the most entertaining film. It is a magnificent portrayal of organized crime. The themes of the movie are sublime. It induces us to empathize with criminals. It is a timeless masterpiece and an exemplary film.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xsmtmayman,10,29 December 2023,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama."

This is the kind of movies that must be in your libraries"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mortin-678-444199,10,6 May 2013,"This film is the film that started so much. From the color scale to the violence and symbolisms. There is no going wrong with this film. Even though the film has been out for over 40 years, it holds it's own to anything made today."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),islam_seif,10,21 November 2022,"Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hiddenhow,9,11 September 2023,"If you haven't watched ""The Godfather"" yet, you're missing out on a cinematic gem that defines excellence in storytelling and acting. This epic saga of the Corleone family is nothing short of a masterpiece. From the impeccable performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and the entire cast to the beautifully crafted narrative, every element of ""The Godfather"" is sheer perfection."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rashid971,9,22 January 2022,"One of the landmarks of motion pictures and its most important products. Yes, the story of the most famous mafia family was presented by Francis Ford Coppola, and he deserved an Academy Award, an exciting and suspenseful story, a majestic cinematography, cast by one of the greatest representatives of the earth, not to mention the immortal music of Aisha except to this day starring the almighty Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davide-giliberti,10,5 December 2023,"What to say? I'm Italian and this movie still looks like to be actual, the characters still play the roles like it's now, today, in this moment."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),timirex1322,10,27 March 2020,"The most memorable movie i have ever seen. I could watch it with my family or anyone, if you're looking for the go-to movie. The godfather should be on your list!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zlx_zjlq,9,18 March 2020,"The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, music eases faint sorrow, and conflicts of interest and human nature conflict. No matter it is acting, the use of lens, music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie requires a great deal of downtime, and you can have a new feeling whenever you turn it over and revisit it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Madhu_chopra,9,14 July 2019,"My all-time favorite movie. No crime drama has ever matched this film or its sequel's intricacy or thoughtfulness. This movie portrayed the Mafia in a new light, examining it as nothing more or less than families with the deepest love for and loyalty to each other. Not to mention all the actors' amazing performances, Coppola's masterful direction, and his and Puzo's faithful adaptation of the book."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),j_shillingford,10,21 December 2017,"All should watch this so powerful I watch this film a lot all actors are beautiful the crew were great too 
Beautiful shoot too"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lazjura,9,23 December 2018,"I'm not a fan of mafia movies. Didn't enjoy Good feelas, Once upon a time in America. However this one is a masterpiece. A blessing to watch. A joy.
I'm only giving a 9 because I didn't understand one of the events in Italy. But I think upon rewatching and rethinking, I'll be quick to change my score to a 10.
Time passed quickly while watching this one. And to say those 3 hours were impactful would be an understatement. A must to see. Definetly a diamond in the mountain of gangster movies.
Absolutely the best performance from Al Pacino. He was best when he was young."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hosting-tr,10,23 November 2022,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. Clouduck. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),russiangypsy777,10,7 August 2005,"I must say this film is the best mobster/gangster movie ever made. The acting is so superb , it was a crime that Pacino was not an Oscar winner for any of these classics! Al goes from an Ivy League College-Boy / War Hero to a cold, calculating mob boss and he does it all to the point where you not only believe the transformation, but applaud it as well ! This was also one of those rare times where the film was actually as good as the book ! And of course there's the music and costumes and vintage cars... it's all a treat for movie-lovers.. If you see only ONE ""mafia"" movie in your life, this MUST be it ! Forget everything you've read or heard about the violent scenes or the glorifying of crime, when it comes down to it, this film is about Family and Loyalty and sadly, the quest for Power and its affect on family and loyalty."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shubhamparab,8,23 January 2019,"Love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Excalibur12ny,10,17 February 2004,"This is Coppola's crowning jewel, if not the 20th Century's. The story follows the legacy of the Corleone Family, one of the Five Families of New York in the 1940's. With accuracy in the time period and perfect accents, the cast of All Stars take over the screen with grace. A young Al Pacino heads the cast as an innocent and yet murderous Michael Corleone. Robert Duvall also gives the performance of his life as the Irish American Tom Hagen. And of course, Marlon Brando steals the scene as Don Corleone. The story tells a tale of family, trust, honor, and respect. Even though the characters are murderers and thieves, they are also fathers, sons, and husbands. This is a must-see for any movie goer. You have not seen American cinema until you have seen ""The Godfather."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mausauceda1,10,22 October 2023,"In each aspect of film making, this movie just keeps delivering, theres a lot of people that by this being an ""old movie"" they wont enjoy it, but this is just not true... you will enjoy every aspect of this movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dinovilija,10,13 February 2016,"The Godfather is the best movie ever. No, sorry, is a masterpiece. Great script, great casting, great music, excellent acting and directing. When somebody asks me to explain this movie: ""I... There are no words. Watch it. That's all I can tell you is watch it. Then you will understand why there are no words to how good this is""﻿ One of the best scenes in all of cinema. The Don gives no loyalty to country or political party. He has no faith in the government or the courts of law. He is fiercely and violently loyal to his family and friends. He abides by a code of ethics. In many ways he has effectively declared himself independent of the government. He looks for no handouts from the government, and he assumes full responsibility for himself, his family, and his friends. This includes the responsibility to wage war if or when necessary. He is ruthless, but not arbitrary. The punishment must fit the crime. He is loyal to his friends, and he expects his friends to be loyal to him. Those who betray are traitors, and traitors are to be put to death. In his own way, he is a dedicated businessman, a politician, a judge, a soldier, a husband, and a father. He provides. He protects. All he asks is for your respect, your loyalty, and your friendship.﻿"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dataze,10,11 February 2017,"Great movie to watch over and over again! epic tale of a 1940s New York Mafia family and their struggle to protect their empire from rival families as the leadership switches from the father to his youngest son. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathise with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove. During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organised crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt. The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): Don't ever take sides against the family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xiguangchenmian,9,28 July 2015,"""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."" This is his negotiating skills.

But before that day, please accept the justice at my daughter's wedding, this is I send you a gift!"" So, what gives the magic of the godfather is so deep? Let he just sat there, between the dark corner of the room, as if place oneself in the center of the universe black hole. People respect him, love him, and fear him, and he is so complex, and so deep. The great thing about the godfather is, he knows himself as emperor ""underground"" of responsibilities: the greater the power, the greater the responsibility. So he always adhere to their own beliefs, no drug harm. For which he refused the drug lords, loss demands, even to a fatal disaster. It is so, ""the godfather"" tells us that as long as you can face the world with dignity, you can live with dignity. So he can casually with top political figures adept, from the bottom of society to the top, he can weave a net intangible and multifarious. So, both in the interests of the family strife and Diocletian Augustus's wiles, godfather always seemed to have all possess the ability and verve, isolated from the sentient beings, overlooking the sky."

Still - the greatest gangster tape, one of the films that turned the world cinema and left a mark on culture comparable to Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. The first time I tried to watch this film was in 2015. And I did not master it. I understood that there was a great and clever canvas in front of me, but I simply could not master it. For me, The Godfather was like a classical music concert: beautiful, but incomprehensible. But, after 5 years, having prepared, I decided to re-watch the film and now everything has changed. I really liked this film, but at the same time I do not like it because of the extremely bad message."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jackamararapu,9,18 June 2021,"The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individua."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joelsaxton,10,14 February 2005,"The Godfather was an epic novel, an excellent story, and the movie could have easily been botched on numerous levels; instead, Francis Ford Coppola managed to create an enduring masterpiece of modern cinema. This excellence he achieved in spite of the constant harassment and general incompetence of Paramount Pictures. Coppola was almost fired by the studio several times during the filming of this classic, yet he managed to persevere and realize his vision through to the end. The casting, direction, acting, cinematography, and story are all top notch. Add to it a beautiful score by Nino Rota and you have the #1 IMDb movie of all time. This is a movie I have watched many times and found few weaknesses."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),witch king,10,28 October 1998,"Most filmgoers who rhapsodize over this wonderful film probably place an inordinate stress on the violence and the politics which connect not only one family, but several, in this sprawling tale of post World War II America. With apologies to those of Italian heritage, I think the tragedy of the Corleones is less a matter of ethnicity than their ruination by blood which is set in motion by two evils: greed and a lust for power. The film is one which sets off the family or clan, [the neighborhood as victim] against the larger, unforgiving American society. The characters are wonderfully realized and splendidly acted. They appear as if drawn to life for the first time. The sinister atmosphere of the film, from its great opening sequence to its frightening close, is a nearly three-hours-long treatise on the disintegration of a family. The Corleones are revealed as equal parts melting kindness and merciless vengeance. The Godfather's turning point is Captain McCloskey's unnecessary assault upon Michael. The meanness of the violent act unhinged the human ideal in the Don's young son. From Michael's understandable love and need to protect his helpless father in an unguarded, creepy hospital emerged his irrevocable decision to cast away any desire to become successful in the eyes of legitimate society. The slow, sure gestation of the plan to assassinate both Captain McCloskey and Virgil Solozzo is one of the major rewards for anyone who loves this film. The seamless transition of Michael Corleone from a patriotic, dutiful, obedient son into a cruelly vengeful and malignant weapon is terrifying portrait. The title of the movie applies to both Don Vito and to Don Michael, with the son slowly eroding the warm and loving family, painstaking built by the father, into a loveless, cheerless collection of individuals adrift on a sea of loneliness and treachery."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aingmire-26563,10,17 August 2021,"WOW! As I am yet to see any of the other Godfather movies, this is the best mafia drama I have ever seen and is definitely a top 10 film! The acting in this is outstanding, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan specific. The plot in this movie is the best plot I have ever seen and it is paced so well!

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),possiblegod,10,26 August 2005,"OH MY GOD!!! I have never watched a film this long before then decided to sit down and watch it again. I've seen plenty this long and although I enjoyed them and watched parts of them again, I have never watched one like this all the way through. Let's take your standard gangster film, either you have the new guy just arrived in town looking for trouble, Joe from 'A fistfull of dollars', or you have the guy looking for revenge, Porter in Payback, or the cop trying to stop them, countless films. THIS IS DIFFERENT!! Sure you might say gangsters have been the guys your rooting for before but no not like this. You start with an established family, and you watch them fall into the ruin and gradually get saved. Brando and Pacino both deserve every award there is for making characters who although are often bad you can still see the old fashioned hero in. Not one bad actor, not one bad character. Not one bad moment. Yet why isn't it no. 1? Well I don't know but it isn't really no. 1 material. Perhaps its the fact you have so much story to take in and so much happens that you aren't sure whats just happened or it could be simple. I could have just expected a no. 1, a film that had me crying, cheering, yelling. I didn't get that but I cant think of one better gangster film, or one other film that deserves to be a classic like this. So perhaps it is a no. 1, for now until a true no. 1 comes along. For those of you who say 'the book was good, not sure if I want to see this', then I'll tell you this. This film is a book. not only is it a book, it's a great book. You cant put it down but when you do you can start anywhere. You can flick back to clarify what has happened, the story is well structured the characters well developed. It's well cut as if it's been edited by a publisher. I don't want to call this no. 1 because when you see it you'll constantly be judging it as a no. 1 film, like I was, and you will feel let down. However if you see it not expecting a no. 1, you will finish it having seen a no. 1."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AlFoster33,10,20 February 2023,"My story with the Godfather started as a growth man, in fact i watchet it for the first time at the age of 21. I'll never forget when the credits rolled over and the music started play. A feeling i have only experienced a couple o times."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),danielzjak,10,2 May 2024,"The Godfather isn't just a gangster movie; it's a sprawling epic that transcends genre. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece dives deep into the Corleone family, led by the aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in an iconic performance). As the film opens, Don Corleone navigates a world of violence and tradition, refusing to sell narcotics unlike other families. This decision sets off a chain of events that throws the family into a bloody conflict."

Marlon Brando and every single actor or actress playing in this movie are almost , if not perfect. The Godfather Part 2 & 3 are equally great and I wish movies today was just a tenth as good as these 3 movies!! Truly the greatest of all time. I could not possible pick a favorite scene because there are one too many iconic moments in this film. Of course if an offer I could not refuse was made to me... There would not be much I could do if you know what I mean. Al Pacino is still my favorite actor, the godfather movies are the reason!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),daniel_ek-76586,10,19 January 2022,"The film is almost three hours, but you can't call it long, making it two hours long would have turned out to be a stump that would have lost its value. In three hours, a whole life unfolded on the screen with all its charms and blows. We can see how people change over time. And what previously seemed alien, wrong in an instant becomes everything in a person's life. As I said, a film of incredible depth, to conquer which you need to see the story to the end."

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, this film has not only stood the test of time but has also solidified its place as a cornerstone of cinematic history."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),razva_deni,10,25 May 2018,"A movie that you can t die without watching it
It combines Crime, Drama, Mafia Business and Personal Life in a unique way."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NotoriousYDW,10,10 July 2012,"There are those rare kind of movies that you can watch over and over again. The Godfather is definitely one of those. It's a timeless work of art. Never have I watched a 3 hour movie that had me gripped from start to finish. It's a movie about family, greed, religion, honor where you really feel for the characters. The story is fantastic, the acting superb(especially Marlon Brando), the music, the set pieces... everything comes together in this masterpiece. It's also on of those few old movies that I can watch again and again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),korzovorze,10,30 October 2017,"one of the best movies i've ever seen! everybody who loves mafia genre, had too bring this one into his collection. may the Italiens was the only one who give you the feeling and a look in the time where the original mafia was present in America and other countries. i think the first part of ""der pate"" is much more better than the others ""der pate2"" and ""der pate3"". it make me a little bit angry, that we had today no more movies like this one!"

It is a masterpiece.."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fackuu94,10,17 August 2019,"I really watch every single movie in the top 250, and a lot more in all my life, but there is nothing close to The Godfather I and II, also Part III is a great ending to this trilogy. This movie is just the best, the characters and performances, the direction, writing, the amazing and classic scenes, everything is at the top of cinema history.
I would love to erase this movie from my mind to experience this ride again. This is for sure, a MUST WATCH."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marmar-69780,10,1 March 2020,"What can be said about godfather that hasnt already been said,godfather is simply one of best films ever made and a must watch for everyone that shares love for movies,godfather has everything incredible cast and performances ,iconic music,great story and grow of characters and their life in criminal world,quateable dialogue with a lot of strong lessons in life we can learn and overall great direction and filmmaking in every way,godfather is simply a masterpiece and i think that this film will been seen and admired in future by many generations to come and they will love this film as much as we love it today"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),provinci-1,10,31 May 2006,"The film is an amazing achievement in cinema. As far as acting and direction goes it is hard to find a better example. An older Brando plays one of his most famous roles, and possibly his second last great role (after this his last notable film appearance was in 1978's Apocalypse Now). It has an amazing storyline and amazing characters. The supporting cast of Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and others make this film one which can never be forgotten or replaced and certainly not replicated. It spawned possibly the most pastiched scene in film and television history (""One day- and that day may never come- i'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this as a token of my appreciation...""). It is a must watch film. So buy the collection and watch now!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fahaddays,10,25 November 2018,"Well! it is a legend! The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name.
It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place on location, primarily around New York and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was principally composed by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.
The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made.
It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall (Best Supporting Actor), and Coppola for Best Director.
The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre, It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part 2 (1974) and The Godfather Part 3 (1990).
I Realy love This Film!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ojbischoff,10,14 January 2024,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The story, goes up with my personal favorites like Scarface and The Shawshank Redemption. I watched this knowing it was a classic although this was better than I thought it would be. It's a must watch film that deserves the rating it has. I couldn't ask for a better movie than this slow, but perfect movie. It's a masterpiece. All of the characters have the perfect placement for this story. I'm a big fan of crime films and Tv shows but I would watch this again. It's one of those movies that's makes you want to watch the sequels to see if it they can even compete with the first film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erichllstrm,10,14 July 2017,"From start to end, you are constantly reminded that you are watching one of the greatest movies ever made. The acting (especially Brando), the directing, the production design, and the cinematography are all top notch. It's long, gripping, thought-provoking - truly an epic in every form."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),collsg,10,17 April 2020,"I like the part when the guy says ""let them lose their souls"" :)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),walterslaughters,8,2 October 2014,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),robcarr1013,9,30 April 2007,"The reason I do not give The Godfather a 10 out of 10 is because it is not the perfect movie. And the reason why The Godfather is not the perfect movie is because it drags. The movie drags for 3 hours and I have to admit that Marlon Brando as the Godfather is a little overrated. I understand his amazing acting ability but i actually thought De Niro did a better job in Part 2. Pacino as Michael is one of the greatest performances in modern cinema. His performance ranks right up there with De Niro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, Ray Liotta in Goodfellas, and Tim Robbins in Shawshank Redemption. I love the Godfather although I do understand the criticism the movie receives from people. (too long, boring at times)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),randydandykkkbb,8,15 March 2019,This film is the godfather to mob movies but not the best. Certainly doesn't do as good a job as some of the more modern films on the same topic.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),markonemac90,10,7 April 2023,"Godfather has always acted like the soul of cinema. After 50 years of its creation, its effects can be seen in the cinema culture and even in personality. The song, characterization, strong script, all show the power of this unique movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elisagomeztaylor,10,14 January 2023,"One of the most captivating TV dramas of our time, especially the first and mostly the second film. I feel a similar captivating element in Tulsa King featuring Sylvester Stallone with the sharpness of tactics and strategies of quick planning to counteract, and quickly. I also love the elegance of style, the well-dressed suits. After a showdown, off to the Peninsula for dinner with maybe minor scratches, sweet too. For the God Father, the characters were very believable especially played in the early years. Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia...well, all of the characters. So rich."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aelistas82,10,15 November 2019,One of the best films that ever will be. Casting is amazing. Movie is amazing.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LLinus,9,23 July 2013,"At three different occasions, i tried to watch this whole movie, this was about 4 years ago.. I don't know maybe i was too young and impatient, but at every single try i never got through it, and i wanted to get through it all because everyone loved it so much and it had good rating and reviews. A few days ago i had to watch it, the whole movie, 3 hours. At first i was thinking ""oh sh*t"", but i just had to get it over with. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saraeltawil,10,30 May 2024,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as a cornerstone of American filmmaking. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this epic tale of the Corleone crime family is both gripping and profound. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's transformation from Michael Corleone to a ruthless mafia boss are outstanding."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lhseaglerunner,10,20 February 2002,"There is really one really good reason to love this movie (SPOILER!!)--the baptism scene just gives me the chills with its brilliant juxtaposition between the start of newlife (the Catholic symbolism of Baptism) and the end of life by some highly-paid hitmen. Absolutely chilling. Other parts may drag a bit, but in reality, nothing can top this one scene."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),avisheksahu99,10,5 August 2023,"This movie could easily be pitched as the most landmark creation in cinematographic history for setting the tone of Social Education in the coming years, given serious cosmetic evolution was just on the cards and more than ever, money just had to sit in the right hands to make social sense. While the thirst for bona-fide business ventures has been ripe within mankind for the longest time, it is just a badly kept secret that sticklers for reputation almost always fall back on triads and godfathers to save their skin from the vengeance of their hitherto ignorant audience suddenly awaken from their poverty induced deep sleep when outsiders take notice of their insouciance and insiders take notice of their pride. Made at the dawn of the fall of the family as a mega-institution, it insinuates that the appeal in gangsters never lay in the fashion or the thrust but in the starkly bare realisation imperative in their context that money finds you only when you have people around you to call family, for what needs to find you needs a road to find you, and the homeless never ever had it easy in times of war and in times of peace!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrmarriedwiththebaseballbat,10,19 December 2020,"This is a movie beeing exemplified by current movies,i don't wanna talk about this movie's light adjustments and small details like that i know big things happen when little things come together but this movie's legendary is not about something like that,The answer about why this movie is a legend, STORY. This movie's story so slow but it is also absorbing people to story and thats the reason why i just want to talk about story.Im going to start from
Micheal's(IM NOT TALKING ABOUT SCOFIELD MR PRISON BREAKER :] ) character change is magnificent its overlap some theory about people character changing, some people thinks (like thomas shelby MR WHO GOT NEARLY ...... EVERYTHING XD) no body never can change but NOPE everybody can change if you create the true possibilities to make him necessitate to be a different human that people will be changed and i think this movie accepting this idea, Corleone's gunshot injury and pressure in family forced Micheal to change his self and also Sunny's bully chracter and his tragic and dramic death supporting so much to story.And the most crucial thing from godfather finding who is traitor and what corleone's using for the find traitor it was ingenious.And now we're going to best scene for me the scene micheal kills sollozzo and mccluskey that was damnnn stressfull is he gonna find the gun is he can shoot them and Al pacino's gestures acting in that second he was making us feel that stress.The second one is its not personaly scene it was showing us hierarchy in family and it was reflecting that hierarchy damn brilliant Sunny's underestimate to Micheal, Micheal's claim that he can do it that was the second best for me.
I dont wanna talk about godfather's Roma philosophy and submissions also if you dont get them i suggest you to learn Roma history and watch that movie again if i going to talk more about godfather i can do it whole night whole week but i cant this was my a little bit funny and little bit interesting review about godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dfredsparks,10,19 November 2002,"I did not become a fan of this film until the early 90s when I saw it on video tape. This film is definitely a masterpiece.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dbabreu,10,24 September 2023,"Francis Ford Coppola is certainly a respected name amongst the film industry, certainly due in part to Apocalypse now and The conversation (Maybe not dementia 13) but almost certainly for the Godfather trilogy. The first two films are peak cinema (The third isn't bad, but fails to reach the same heights.) with Coppola not being afraid to show the dark,gritty, ugly world of the Mafia. The Corelones are terrifying because they are such well-versed, attractive people. However, this is merely a front for their ruthless, uncompromising nature, turning on their so-called allies in a blink of an eye. There are many lessons in the film that are directly taken from Nicolas Machiaveli's The prince, regarding power, as well as a hint of Shakespeare's Macbeth. All these combine for a violent, dark, but artistic film, the likes of which may never be rivaled. Except maybe, by it's direct successor."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dmarski,10,14 June 2013,"Old cult cinema. Great movie. Some movies you just have to see. Although the production is young, it really keeps you in suspense. You could do it with little effort cool movie in the seventies. It is known that there were so many sound effects and light but there feel the atmosphere of American cinema. May passion for cinema is one of the two because the first is a medical emergency, major who is studying for two years. I hope that in the future I will be able to help people and work in a close-knit team of people who have a passion for what they do. Certainly, however, will not give up keeping abreast of what goes on the screen. Only in recent films miss the message. The focus is to contract the most popular actor. Increasingly, however, are valued directors who are not afraid to make difficult subjects, it can sometimes controversial. I like the cinema."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Nicoletn11,9,26 August 2005,"This movie is awesome. I've been in love with this movie (and the other two) since I was a young girl. And I think partly due to this movie, I love movies with violence. Not that this movie has tons of violence in it, but it has enough to leave a lasting impression on a young person. It has been said many, many times before that ""all I need to know, I learned from the Godfather"" and truer words have never been spoken. At it's core, The Godfather is about family values. This movie isn't only about the mob or drugs or any of those things that's just one part of it, but ultimately, it's about family. Despite not exactly having anything in common with the characters, this movie has left a mark on my life that could not have been placed there by another movie. This is THE best movie. Great job Puzo & Coppola. RIP Mr. Puzo."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joshtjj,9,28 September 2020,"While certainly a little overrated, the Godfather still holds up as an amazing movie with some of the most iconic characters, moments and lines in all of film. The story is a crime drama that follows the leader of a massive crime family passing the torch to his youngest and most reluctant son. The genius and appeal of the story not only lies in its well executed structure and masterful dialogue, but also the realism and accuracy with which it tells a story about the mafia. However the film would be nothing without the characters and the actors that play them. Al Pachino is indeed fantastic in the film, and Robert Duvall is also good, but the film belongs to Marlon Brando. His performance as Vito Corleone is legendary and the character has become one of the best and most loved in all of fiction. This is an absolute masterpiece, though not quite the greatest of all time, and will remain a huge part of film history forever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmedfouadeldin,10,12 March 2014,"I got to watch the fourth bonus DVD celebrating 25 years of the first movie, after watching the behind scenes and the work done by the film crew, I cant agree more that his movie is the best ever made. I watched the fourth DVD which includes the Godfather Notebook, it's how Coppola wrote the script for the movie on the exact papers of the original novel by cutting every single page of the novel and paste it in an A4 frame that will make the footnote bugger so he can write the script on each page of the original novel. Some of the greatest scenes were Coppola first hearing the sound track by Nino Rota on a cassette tape, and Robert De Niro playing the role of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone during the casting for the role. It's really a very good DVD and it shows how a great movie was done."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),drvihan,10,28 November 2021,"There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Pozzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all."

I like this movie because it shows, how real man were, how to be a real man. Nowdays you don't see this that much, the people don't honor the elders and there are many more snitches than it used to be. The respect for people is gone. Everybody thinks that they are tough, but when it comes to real situation they turn their backs around and walk away. In this movie you see the opposite. You see how everything was handeld and you know what it was the good way I think. The life is tough and if we don't face it that way like in this movie we cant survive.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hani_78696,10,4 August 2013,"I have had this movie for many months but i never got time to watch it. Yesterday i did and i think ,like everybody say ,it is one of the best movies made ever. Al Pacino who was not very popular at that time make his breakthrough performance and he is just great in the role of Michael Corleone. About the legend Marlon Brando,he is just phenomenal,his facial expressions and husky voice just make his role one of the best characters. It is based on Mario Puzo's novel about five fictional mafia families and Must say he did a great job on screenplay too. There are some great as well as shocking scenes in this movie i.e. When Woltz wake up and finds a real severed head of a horse. Sonny beats up his brother-in-law Carlo. Prolonged fight between Connie and Carlo. Death of Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone. Death scene of Sonny ambushed by gang members at toll. The killings of all the other heads of Mafia families,Moe Green,Tesiso and Carlo. I loved the setting and style. James Caan,Richard S. Castellano,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton & Talia Shire did great jobs too. Despite the many Anachronisms,this movie is just marvelous. I have read everything that Coppola dis to make this movie so outstanding. Maybe the best gangster movie ever made. Thanks Paramount,Francis Ford Coppola and every Cast-crew member related for producing this chef-d'oeuvre."

Great Direction. Flawless acting. Entertaining & thrilling moments. In short a great movie. Easily the best crime drama I have seen. Loved watching every moment of it. Marlon Brando is easily at his best in this movie. Along with several other actors. A must watch for all movie buffs. Especially the fans of crime drama genre. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right."

The Godfather is my all time best. It starts out in a unique fashion, a story giving us an insight into the life of a mafia group and how it became a family business span of over three to four generations. This story is encapsulated with love, politics, religion, betrayal, trust and everything regular thing you can find in life. There has never been a movie like this that catches my attention like this one and there might not be another. I love the entire story and there was never a dull moment. I don't do any other thing while watching the Godfather it is not possible.I like the story, the cast, the everything.It's a must watch movie."

Its all here and its made for a great classic which has stood the test of time after 30+ years! Al Pacino is awesome as is Marlon Brando. The ruthless streak to Pacino is horrifyingly chilling and is brilliantly acted. It deserves to be at number one because it is that good! My favourite movie of all time with some classic quotes! The way Coppola shows loyalty, respect and not playing by the rules are all shown and this makes for great viewing. Pacino's best film in my opinion!"

I hope one day when I get into films , that I would manage to do a action films and dress up as mafias. I would definitely recommend this film. If you are looking for ideas to prank or get revenge this film is worth watching.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part- III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pepemartinezmarin,9,25 October 2021,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ajk11,10,10 September 2000,"There are very few films that can completely hold the viewers attention for their entire duration, and even fewer that are nearly 3 hours long, yet The Godfather manages to do exactly this. It is wonderfully acted and directed, with stand out performances from Marlon Brando, James Caan, and Al Pacino."

It's taken multiple excuse-less years of avoidance for me to finally muster up the time and energy to consume this delight and, now that I've finally seen it, I'm happy to say that it IS indeed a brilliant, powerful, and borderline perfect masterpiece!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),z-12781,10,16 June 2020,"The Godfather's discussion of religion looms large, with the boundaries of good and evil blurred by grace, warmth, kindness and family. The godfather upends the conventional wisdom about the gangster. Instead of being a bully, the gangster can be gentle and gentle. The director orchestrates mass assassinations and deftly USES a cross-montage of revenge. When Marlon Brando spoke in the calmest of voices that he would make an offer he could not refuse, the violence of the underworld was maximized and great aesthetic tension was generated."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Izzit249,10,28 December 2002,"I am sorry t say that the commentary made by francis coppola at the end of part 3 on the DVD editon clearly states that for the last ten years of Mario Puzo's life they discussed a possible part 4 of the godfather, hoping that they could evolve upon the rise the corleone family business, as a whole. I.e.: how they gained political influence among society, how michael grew distant and how the rest of them drew close, and then skip 40-50 years ahead to vincent corleone losing the bussiness that was worked upon so hard to gain, through drugs and loss of all political influence and respect, whilst haunted by the loss of his cousin love, and ironically have one final scene with Michael and vincent before michael died. i.e.: this would be a part 2 narrative."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dongpyo-70231,9,15 May 2020,"The gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, the music soothes the faint sadness, the interest game human nature conflict. Whether it is acting or lens, the use of music, give people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this film is extremely need to sink down to savor carefully, and no matter when it comes out to relive can have new thinking."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alnasserfadi,10,18 October 2016,"The godfather is the most favorite movie ever the three parts are the most great movies in the history in my opinion it contain the fathers of our cinema now days, a story that tell the truth about the mafia and even the people who control the illegal business and the way that end up. shows the family that always feel proud of its own Sicilian origin's i already watched this movie more that 12 time with friends, family, and I'm even ready to watch it more and more, Don Corleone is one of my favorite characters and the way he always shows of the strong man that doesn't know how to bow and give up easily and at the same time you can see the part of care about his family in the last seine and the part of killing his eldest son Tom, and always KEEP YOUR FRIEND CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMY CLOSER."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aellsayed,10,4 May 2020,"I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone.
Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, ""The Godfather"" is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made.
With performances, style and substance to savour, this shows how it is possible to smash box office records without being mindless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CubsandCulture,9,30 December 2018,"This is a very good film, with well drawn and engaging characters. It is also impeccably acted which coupled with Coppola's eye for detail really helps the world feel authentic. The script's biting criticism of American capitalism is well done and subtle. It is perhaps too subtle because people tend to miss it upon first viewing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Preston-10,10,16 December 2000,"MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER (that is the full name of the film) is haunting, gothic, thought-provoking and an excellent sociological study. On the surface, this is a story about organized crime, loyalty, and family. On the subsurface, Coppola weaves brilliant themes about parallel identities and the profound influence of example. In essence, THE GODFATHER isn't a gangster film; it is too intricate and genuine of a film to be characterized as simply a `gangster film'. Much of the importance of the movie lies in the actual character of the Godfather. Marlon Brando's Godfather seems to represent an individual who is world-weary, but yet, not disillusioned to the point of extending loyalty to others. We look at THE GODFATHER from the standpoint of an individual on the outside looking in. Even though the opening scenes take place in the midst of a wedding, this is a closed society to us. Criminals and cold-blooded killers dance, sing, and play with all the innocence of children. And yet, we want to be close to many of these people once the movie ends. When an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera asks the Godfather to perform a service for him the patriarch reminds him of the fact that Bonasera never ""wanted his friendship"" and that he couldn't remember the last time he was invited over for a ""cup of coffee"". We may relate to the many times that we, like Don Corleone, extended our friendship and loyalty to others but never got it in return. I know too many people that are more concerned with having someone else do something for them than returning any sort of favor. It's amazing that as powerful of a figure the Godfather is, he also looks at the small acts that characterize friendship. I began to relate to him so much I began to wish that all fathers could retain many of the beautiful characteristics that this man possesses. This is not to deify the character lead of Coppola's film. After all, the Godfather is a criminal. And yet, when he dies in the film, it's as if the World has suffered a great loss. I actually cried during this scene the first time I saw it when I was a kid. It is interesting to note that we are not supposed to respect the criminal organization in this film. After all, the extent to which a person is protected in the Don's extended criminal family is often related to the extent to which a character is willing to shed blood. A good member must be willing to break the law and deny one's friends but never their family. In essence, the movie is filled with paradoxes (not in plot, but in the characters themselves). We see a grandfatherly figure that pulls the strings of a criminal organization. We witness the transformation of the good son to the calculating killer. We see benevolence in many of the supporting characters that are willing to kill. THE GODFATHER is a movie that is more complicated and intricate than people are willing to admit. As a result, at our access is one of the most fascinating character studies."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),colddog-59601,10,8 April 2024,"If I remember it correctly, this is my 3rd or 4th time watching this movie. First time was in my university years or earlier, I still remember how I was overwhelmed by the plethora of faces, names, relationships and the rapid succession of different scenes in the movie, that I fell asleep within 15 minutes. Later when I grew more, I finished watching the movie and began to really like it. Still I must say there was a lot that I failed to understand in the movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ethanpearce,10,16 January 2022,Having watched the film only once maybe my opinion isn't the best but I really enjoyed it. Everything that you would expect from a classic New York gangsta film and all the characters fit their role perfectly. I love how Al Pacino slowly becomes more and more involved in the family and sometimes we have to do things we don't want to.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),krispykreme14,10,1 October 2000,"The AFI rated The Godfather the third best movie ever.  Only citizen Kane and Casablanca were higher.  I haven't seen citizen Kane, but I have seen Casablanca, and that can hold a very, very small candle to this masterpiece. In this movie nothing is gratuitous or useless.  The dialouge is perfect. Even though this is a three hour movie, all the scenes still stick in my mind.  Only great movies do that to you.  If you see it, you'll see what I mean."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Immanox21,9,23 May 2021,"Despite of the fact that this movie is so long, I watched it tens of times. Every time I watch, I feel like to start a gang and get killed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wadeadmorose,10,23 April 2024,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not merely a film; it is an enduring phenomenon in cinematic history.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vaoloto188,9,10 October 2020,"I believe that anyone standing in a high or low position in society should watch this film. It reflects many aspects and carries many different meanings, especially the way of living and treating people with each other."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),olivercase-83355,10,18 July 2019,"Honestly this review is going to be short because this film is excellent in any field you could imagine - visually amazing, acting more convincing than any movie I've ever seen, the score is iconic and the screenplay is so vast in scale, but manages to be amazing. if you put the end of this movie next to the start, it wouldn't make any sense, but just as all great films, it makes sense anyway while immersing you into the cinematic experience. If you haven't seen, then you need to free up a morning or evening with or without friends and watch it with your undivided attention."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheMovieDiorama,9,27 February 2018,"Of all time. Of. All. Time. To have an accolade such as that isn't just impressive, it's near impossible (especially by today's standards). The consequences of acquiring such an achievement results in expectations being sky high, not just for first time watches but for multiple viewings as well. For me, it's a first time watch...the ultimate question is: Is this really the greatest film ever made? I cannot answer that, not after one viewing. It's an incredible behemoth at 177 minutes. Now I always say ""honesty is the best policy"", so with that in mind...my one and only criticism, the pace stagnates occasionally. The plot sometimes comes across as monotonous, whether that be due to the film's length or the actual substance. However, before you destroy my opinion and cast me out for lack of credibility, The Godfather is truly a phenomenal film. It's aged incredibly well since 1972 and is one of the few films I've seen where every scene is packed with rich characters, traditionalism and sharp dialogue. It's meticulously crafted. Coppola's direction was, dare I say, perfect. Nothing seemed out of place, although there was one fight scene where the punches were so far away from the actor's...but that's an absurdly minor gripe. Marlon Brando was palpable. He exhumed power, control and vulnerability. A patriarchal figure in a family struggling to stay in authoritative control in a time of corruption, deceit and betrayal. The screenplay beautifully captures the balance of the crime world and a hearty Sicilian family where traditional values are considered in both of these different environments. To most people, family is everything. The film really conveys that in a sensitive yet compelling way. Pacino was fantastic. Rita's score was utterly memorable. Puzo's screenplay was full of life. It's so much to take in one viewing that I'm sure my rating will change in the future. But I cannot deny there were moments when I looked at my watch. Some say the sequel is superior, so I have high hopes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marylandflower,8,19 September 2017,"The Godfather is a very intense viewing experience. I really liked how they used the bottom lighting so he could not really see who was talking at the beginning, it left a sense of suspense about it. The suspense of what could this person's business be what is there business what do they do. Why are they coming to the Godfather for help? The other thing I really like about the film is how before he goes to get the gun from the bathroom to shoot the men in the restaurant. When he gets to the bathroom he takes the gun and has to calm himself down, then he goes to shoot the guys and hears the sound of a train right before he does it. I feel that the intensity of the train noise rising as he is about to shoot them was a brilliant choice of thing to do because it shows how he is thinking about it. I do not like how they used low lighting all the time. I get it is a dark type of movie but it does not need that type of lighting like all the time. They could have used neutral lighting because that is not light but not dark at the same time. I feel like that would have worked better because low lighting ended up making the scene look way darker than it had to be. The Godfather was a very good movie and overall it was a very nice movie with an amazing story-line. The way they portrayed most of it was amazing but when they overused some of the lighting is what made me kinda feel off about how some parts of the movie may not be that great. I did like a lot of the sounds in his head."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EJGlenn,10,22 November 2017,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),epicgamerfilms,10,12 August 2023,"There's not much I can say that can do this film justice. It is a one of a kind masterpiece that will go down in history as the gangster movie that all other gangster movies will be held to as the standard and that seems unfair as no other film can replicate what this film achieved. Everything about it is perfect. The story, the direction, the lighting, the mood, the acting, the imagery, the music, and so much more. This is a must watch for any movie goer and should be seen before you die. Francis ford Coppola managed to create a cinematic icon that people will continue to watch forever. This is possibly the greatest movie of all Time and I don't think anyone would argue otherwise."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),armanmarok,10,3 April 2012,"Steven Spielberg once said he considered retiring after watching The Godfather. Stanley Kubrick admitted The Godfather may very well be the greatest movie ever made and without a doubt has the best cast. If two of the greatest directors of all time had claimed such statement, what more needs to be said about this masterpiece, really? By now, it's already a stuff of legend. Countless lists and people have rated this as the finest motion picture to ever grace the silver screen. The genre and cinema itself have been heavily influenced by the contents in the movie, and even real-life mafias mimicked how Don Vito Corleone, portrayed by Marlon Brando in what I consider to be the most splendid acting job done by any actor or actress in any movie ever, carried himself. When did you ever hear something like that happened? If there was ever any? I doubt Francis Ford Coppola himself would have thought his first big directorial job would have given birth to an enduring legacy THIS big. Sure, he had Marlon Brando in his pocket, complete with Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, and Robert Duvall as future stars just to name a few, which must have been exciting for a young director for that time. But I still doubt Coppola would have known he was directing the greatest motion picture of the 20th century even once during the entire 62 days of shooting, even when he, the entire casts, and the entire crews gave it their all for those 62 days. But that magic was there. And it is now known throughout the world as The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bill-422,10,21 June 1999,"One of the greatest films ever made!  It stars Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Rober Duvall and James Caan as members of a powerful mob family.  Brando is unforgettable and Pacino's transformation from responsible son to menacing thug is eerily effective.  Some unforgettable scenes include the shooting in a deli.  This is the greatest crime film ever made and stands as a great ""male"" soap opera. Don't forget about the Godfather Part 2!  You'll miss more of the greatness! (The Godfather Part 3 is good, but poor by comparison)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Gavinp-Jackson-1987,9,17 September 2022,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay written by Mario Puzo and Coppola. The movie is based on Italian-American Mafia member Joseph ""Joe"" Bonanza's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. It follows the story of Michael Corleone, a mafia kingpin who attempts to legitimize his criminal enterprise and keep his family from being torn apart."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DocD456,8,21 May 2004,"The Godfather, an electrifyingly well made film. Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, just naming the heavy hitting stars. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a mafia family living in New York. The Don's main source of income is gambling and protection. Another head of another mafia family (Sollozzo) wants to sell drugs to gain profit, Don Vito hates the idea of selling drugs on the market, so an attempt to take his life is made. One special son of the Godfather is brought to light when this event happens. In the film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the films gives the viewer a feeling of sympathy for a mob family, when in reality, a person does not usually take the side of a mob family, doing things against the law to make profit. A couple of the ways this happens is the fact that it's felt that Don Corleone is trying to do the `right' and `honest' way to make his profit by not selling drugs. Also, by the death and injury of many family members, the film brings a feeling of understanding, sympathy, and compassion towards the Corleone's. The film includes numerous scenes of murder, often in an offensive amount. Some scene feature hideous lights jobs, to the point of not seeing the character's faces, or telling what is happening. Although very monotonous, the music and soundtrack the movie was well done, and really changed the feel of individual scenes. There was an excellent job of doing crescendos and making diminuendos of certain scene to build suspense, or foreshadowing an event. Overall, the acting was superb, great casting, very well conceived and structured plot. I give The Godfather 8.5 out of ten."

The movie is showing how powerful Godfather really is. No major plot twists or anything like that but it's a great gangster movie.
The movie is made up of many independent scenes, the first scene itself is catching.
Must watch, a little bit lagging if seen for the first time, yet a good movie."

I mean with all due respect if you can't appreciate how phenomenal this movie is then maybe the problem is in with you .
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheNabOwnzz,9,30 April 2019,"Whereas some films disregard immediate reality and seek to convey a certain message in its sub text, The Godfather is the kind of motion picture that seeks to bring forth reality exactly how it was, and does this by creating a kind of family bonding that is as near perfectly structured as it can be."

There has never been a better movie and there never will be a better one and I'll tell you why. Everything came together for this movie, the acting, music, screenplay, setting, the characters and the story. It did something rare it brought crime and family together in an almost mythical way. Also it brought Marlon Brando (The Godfather) as a passing Don to a new generation (Al Pacino), in essence the transfer of  power  was being passed from one generation to another Brando to Pacino, and in the second movie it was Brando to DeNiro. Aside from their great performances, James Caan and Robert Duvall were flawless. James Caan turns in the performance of a lifetime as Sonny Corelone, and Duvall is flawless as Consilgere to the Don. If you have read the book you know will know why it was perfectly transfered from the book to the big screen. Their will never be legends such as Brando and Pacino ever again, they became the characters, they weren't acting, THEY BECAME the characters. I still get chills down my spine at the end of the movie when that the door closes and the transfer of power is complete from Father to Son. Don Corleone to Michael. It is unforgettable, and the legend grows with every viewing of the film."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sevinc-zorbey,10,6 September 2013,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990. The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gardening-69307,10,8 September 2022,I watch this movie like once a year. It's the perfect movie. Great cast and director. Music is historic. Amazing script. The movie has no flaws. I love this film and I love part 2 (part 3 not so much lol)
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mflahfhad,10,12 December 2022,"After watching The Godfather, I searched for films to compete and compare this film, but I did not find it, and I expect that I will not find a better one. This film I make sure that everyone I know watches it. Even with the greatness of the second part, I see the first part as greater than it, even though they are all great. I am now continuing to watch the movie to confirm that there is nothing better than it. I watched it five times and think of the sixth and seventh. For me, I classify three as the best of the Godfather trilogy, and this is thanks to the first part of it being great. And thanks."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),veronica121971,10,22 June 2013,"The first movie of one of the best trilogies of all times. A classic. With outstanding performances from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and an incipient, but extremely talented Al Pacino. The GodFather transports you to the dark world of the Italian Mafia, how they managed their business, their families. Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), head of one of the five Italian mafia families, manages to control his business (Alcohol, Game, Women) with his son Sonny (James Caan), his stepson Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and his loyal friend Clemenza. He develops good social relations with the Government, and important business men. When other families want to take advantage of Don Corleone's relations, in order to introduce drugs and deal with them, Don Corleone refuses to share his contacts. A war between families starts with an apparent truce. A must-watch trilogy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),volkanozbek,10,9 June 2019,A film that makes people think about life. I'm so glad I watched it before I died.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JameelChoudhary,10,30 March 2021,"The first time the first part of the movie was a different feeling of watching such movie with such great concept and actors at to the point with so reality in each and every character, the story lines, the overall climax of the scene was like it's should be a never ending story such was the vision of the story. I wish we could have more parts in the 20s as well...!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tommyanderson-40404,10,7 February 2018,"There is very few films I will give a 10. This is the film that help redesign a new era of filmmaking. It was so influential and so well made that the film is still just as popular today as it was when it was first released 1972. The only other films from the 1970's that I can think that is still gaining huge amount of fans is ""Grease"" and ""Jaws"". Now I might not give those films a 10 but it does show that films from the 1970's set the mold for films and filmmakers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gokhanguzeler,10,5 October 2021,"This is not just movie, it is an emotion. The dialouges are very comfortable the acting level is incomparable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lachezarmatneshliev,9,4 March 2024,"Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be... As for the storytellng, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that carefully crafted. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the desert stone -- devastating humor, definitive conclusion. In scene wedding and songs, Mr. Coppola crafted an enduring, undisputed masterpiece. A great American picture, full of incredible images and lasting moments. Moving chronicles of American life, designed within the limits of popular entertainment. Next year, when enough mans dies it has 31 wins & 31 nominations..!? The incredible language and the childhood room..!?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EmptyLeo,9,19 August 1999,"It took me a while to get this movie watched from beginning to end, as it seems I would always catch it a half hour or so in. I'd never want to watch a movie that's supposed to be as great as this after missing the first ½ hour. Then there were the times I'd catch it on HBO, TMC or Showtime late at night and fall asleep (admit it, it does get off to a slow star). Finally i stole my brother's set of all three Godfather movies and watched front to back. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeremygeorgelakecharles,10,19 May 2021,This is a movie that went down in history as a classic. I think that one of the problems that period cinema has is to overcome time and stay current in a decade where the cinema bombards us with shocking images created by computer. The films that survive despite not having these resources are masterpieces and The Godfather is undoubtedly one of these masterpieces of cinema.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),huangfugeng,10,6 April 2021,"I love this movie the movie is very good. Francis Ford Coppola's films spanned 20 years in the making and gave us many memorable characters and a glimpse into the horrors of the Mafia. But the movie, in my opinion, deserves better reviews. Mostly the complaints of the critics are upon the fact that the movie doesn't seem to work as a standalone and Sophia Coppola's acting is bad, but considering someone watching today, in a world governed by movie franchises built in reference to predecessor movies, this argument falls flat. As for the latter, i do agree that her acting in acts1 and 2 were flat, but she quickly made up in the 3rd act."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mailriseup,9,30 May 2023,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an undeniable masterpiece that has solidified its place as one of the greatest films in cinematic history. Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, this iconic crime drama weaves a complex and compelling narrative of power, family, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of organized crime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mapsusnet,10,7 September 2021,This is a great movie. You won't be disappointed if you watch this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Vegaskid,9,5 December 2005,"OK, I am 32 and have seen the vast majority of this film several times, particularly when I was younger. I have just bought the DVD boxed set for £20 and watched the 1st film the WHOLE way through for the 1st time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),labdigitalera,10,9 May 2024,"Then there may be the rating by way of Nina Rota. One phrase, exquisite! I actually have heard many fantastic ratings in my lifetime, but after listening to this score few stick within the memory as an awful lot because the score for The Godfather. This rating is both stunning as seen with the principle subject, and haunting inside the manner it sticks on your head after watching the movie itself. Other first rate assets are the masterly course from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay this is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, a number of it's miles shocking and extreme specially within the climax which changed into sufficient to nearly make your heart both beat twice as rapid or stop, and I nearly blanketed my eyes when the manufacturer observed the pony's head in his mattress, however below that this family is quite unswerving and honourable come to consider it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LawrenceYeo,9,24 March 2017,"Godfather script portrays the duality of man: good vs evil, law abiding vs crime, loyalty vs betrayal, logic vs emotions, etc. It also warns of the long term consequences of our actions despite our short term intents and factors driving us to a certain path, which in the protagonist life, is crime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),billcody,9,2 September 2002,"Like Citizen Kane, the Godfather is extremely influential, but more than a bit overrated. Coppola has essentially one trick - intercuttung violence with religious ceremonies. In the first two Godfather films this is an extremely effective device. Unfortunately, some of the other parts of this film are not quite as well thought out. The scenes of Michael in Italy are too long and underdeveloped. Appolonia falls for Michael in a way that only happens in the movies so the audience has very little emotional investment in her or her death. Most people would say I'm nitpicking, but to be honest there are more than a few films that I have enjoyed more than the Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mesutuoan,10,23 May 2021,MASTERPIECE. BEST MOVIE EVER. IM RATED 10 FOR TOP 1.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gauravsharmam,9,2 July 2020,"A great and most loved gangster movie. Godfather is a very simply made movie with full of crime elements going on in it , concern about family , royalty and fate - mixed with very expensive and classy production putted brutally in front of us is the best thing I've ever seen in my life. No doubt Francis Ford Coppola is best in making crime dramas and actors like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as two crime gods ,just❣❣👌. Every single scene of this film is like inspiration and self cautioning."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chubarova,10,7 April 2020,"I'n not the great critic, I'm just a person, who loves cinema. If you are like me, you must watch this film. All features in it are on their place. Firstly, the story is based on Mario Puso's book, I really recommend to read it, and this film used almost all book, expect the storyline about young Vito (director used it in sequel). Secondly, all actors did the amazing performance: Brando, Al Pachino, Duvall and others created great film. Thirdly, music and costumes made the atmosphere of late 40s.
So, it's really one of the greatest film ever.
So,"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JennaInk,10,30 March 1999,"Probably the third best crime/mafia movie ever behind Godfather II and Goodfellas. Still how could you possibly say Al Pacino as Michael is not excellent. What a casting ensemble, Pacino, Brando, DuVall, Caan, Cazale--very hard to top that. 10!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),araf-khan03,9,16 April 2014,"'Mafia' - whenever the word hits the mind, a bewildering aura or gesture accumulates the thoughts and forces the urgency to create a visualization of certain characteristics. The best possible visual outcome of the definite word 'Mafia' would be 'The Godfather'. From hearing the Italian accent to grasping the tone of underworld organized crime, this movie provides ground for the marvelous portrayal of seemingly oblivious to conceptualize."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),medosna,9,24 November 2019,Its my first time to write a review but i can say with confidence that The Godfather the best movie i have seen ever
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BrandoLarson,10,29 June 2020,"Very few films of today can compete with The Godfather (1972). This is a must see for all movie buffs, and chances are you've already seen or heard about it. Marlon Brando gives an outstanding Oscar worthy performance, which earned him an Oscar to which he ""refused."" Al Pacino stars and gives stellar acting toward the film, and in my opinion this catapulted his movie career into stardom. Francis Ford Coppola directs phenomenally, and the film is as close to realism as you can get. Everything is tops from: the screenplay, the acting, cinematography, etc. You will not be disappointed; this film will forever stand the test of time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hurdaciistanbul,8,15 December 2023,"One of the all-time greats, The Godfather showcases masterful filmmaking that contends for the title of the best film ever made. Its portrayal of the underworld is unparalleled."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bronson9191,10,10 May 2016,"I'll keep it short because it's all been said at one point or another. Without a doubt, The Godfather is one of the best of all-time. Its a rarity when a film is firing on all cylinders; from story, cast, cinematography, editing, directing, etc. Francis Ford Coppolla gives us such a beautifully crafted story that its easy to miss some of the wonderfully subtitle (yet so grand) acting going on within it. Marlon Brando is something to behold as he plays one of the most iconic characters in film history. A man responsible for such terrible things, and yet you're rooting for him in almost every scene. The way he pushes his character to the brink of madness in the most subtle of ways should be a textbook for future actors. For anyone that is a fan of the ""gangster"" film genre its a must-see. If one can't appreciate the content of the story, one has to admire how the story is presented."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samurai-vignesh,10,15 May 2007,"it is not good as pulp fiction, because this film just shows that an older mafia dies and his son takes control, this type of films are more common,but pulp fiction which is a master piece and narrates an hit mans story with good type of narrating. this film does not deserve to be in 1st place, because they didn't made any effort on acting. it also has many errors on film making.this film was a good movie for those who saw the movie in the olden days, but now the this film has no effect on the viewer, but movies like pulp fiction, the shaw shank redemption are really extraordinary creations of directors. i don't know why it is still stuck in the 1st place."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elliottkemp-53971,10,26 February 2024,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Anyone who praises this film, whether it be the acting, directing, editing, score, or anything else that makes a movie a movie is right. It's so absolutely perfect. It's runtime is really hard to feel when almost every single scene is incredibly interesting, and even if a few aren't it's not an enough to matter in my eyes. The performances are some of the greatest I've seen in a long time, if ever. The writing is so good at conveying exactly what it needs to, and the directing is some of the best ever. The story is nothing short of incredible, and seeing it be brought to life with such impeccable filmmaking is nothing short of incredible. There's a reason this is essential watching, and there's a reason that so many praise this film. They're right. What else can I say, it's the Godfather for crying out loud. Absolutely phenomenal."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Comandante666,10,17 September 2003,"This movie has a lot of history. I used to describe it as one of the best movies ever. This was when I still was a boy and mafia-movies were so exciting. Don't get me wrong, 'The Godfather' is still an amazing excitement to watch and if I have time I still do watch it. But with this movie it is as it is with so many things in life. Time shows that it is only a thing, or as it is in this case, a movie. Therefore I recommend to anybody who hasn't watched 'The Godfather' already: don't hesitate any longer. Watch it now! It is a beautiful story, great acting, and definitely a movie you won't forget. But for those who have seen this film, maybe many times already...don't discard it, I suppose it has become part of your own history. Enjoy talking about it, love watching it, and don't waste it by naming it the 'Best movie ever'."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LongShadyEyes,10,6 January 2003,A true classic. I love the Godfather trilogy. It's #1 on my list and it will stay that way. Al Pacino is so incredible in this movie. I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Michael Corleone as Pacino did. He is such an intense actor...the best actor in my opinion.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jayghoshjan,10,18 August 2020,"Strangling in between the golden age of hollywood and new hollywood , a watershed moment in cinematic history .

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),VStefan08,10,2 September 2023,"A masterclass in film making. The best plot, excellent music and 3 hours full of saspens. A short trip in Italy along with gangsters and killers. The strong family effect in the whole movie. The cast which plays here, contains 3 or 4 best actors of all time. Jack Nicholson had be proposed to play... Maybe did wrong?! Who knows... Al Pacino in his best perfomance. The classic Italian style, with the suits, the expensive way of life and that moment you lose everything in 2 minutes. The parallel scene of the baptism of good and the death of bad. One of the most shocking moments in the history of cinema."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vman,10,22 October 2001,"Well the Godfather is really one of the best adaptation of novel to book. I know that there are probably few of the newer viewers of this movie who read the book, but if you first read the book when the book first came out in the 70's and waiting patiently for the movie to be released you weren't  disappointed in the movie. I think it is the best gangster movie and if you are fortunate to own the DVD you are in for a treat. There are lots of goodies here."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chinguun1983,10,20 May 2016,"God Father 1,2,3 is the one of the best trilogy film. I watched it more than ten times. Every time watch this film I learn new things. This film gives me cinematic feeling, love to the film, gives me power to create new film. Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro are the greatest actors of all. They all two complete the film. The music, the motion, the cinematography, the dialogues no words to explain, no words to compare. God Father 1,2,3 became the legend in world cinema history.

This is 'The Godfather' of gangster movies and indeed movies in general. Every award won was completely deserved. Francis Ford Coppola absolutely nailed it with this stunning movie.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),carolina-piazza,9,25 April 2021,"A thrilling film that explores the Italian mafia and reveals its codes and rituals. Its rhythm, the lights, the omerta, the climate of tension contribute to plunge us into the heart of this microsome known only by initiates. Many scenes such as the assassination attempt of Vito Corleone and the aftermath are so striking that they remain engraved in us as ""Do not tell me that you are innocent because it is an insult to my intelligence and it makes me in a bad mood.""
A pure timeless masterpiece to see and see again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),apresti-49215,10,25 January 2022,There is no other crime movie that comes even close to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather. Marlin Brando delivers a stunning performance alongside Al Pacino. This is a movie that truly anyone can enjoy and appreciate.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stebbif-2,10,18 April 2000,"The best movie of the seventies and one of my personal top five movies of the 20th century, and perhaps the best american movie of all time. It is a very good description of the mafia life in the USA in the middle of the 20th century. Everything in this movie is masterful: the direction, the script which is based on the hit novel ""The Godfather"" by Mario Puzo, the fantastic music, the cinematography and last but certainly not least the superb actors in it. Marlon Brando is magnificent as the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and got a very well deserved oscar for his superb portrayal (This is one of the best parts of the movie history and he is unforgettable as the patriarch of the Mob family), Al Pacino is also very good in the role of Michael Corleone (this role marked the beginning of his elegant career), James Caan is good as Sonny, academy award winner Robert Duvall is also unforgettable as Tom Hagen and Academy Award Actress Diane Keaton is very good as Kay. This is one superb movie for all those who are truly historic masterpiece movie fans and for those which like the best of the best in the movie history. This movie is one of the very best. An unforgettable movie experience"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dokunratmi,10,29 August 2022,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received."

I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."

No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rewaFDF,10,30 January 2005,"This is movie making at it's best, with a golden tinge in each camera frame.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Collectorbrna_,10,24 September 2023,"One of the best crime movies in cinema formats. I can watch this movie without getting bored, even if it can be compensated for Al Pacino's extraordinary acting. It also has the ability to maintain serial recording storage in the best possible way. Each movie is enjoyable in its own way. It's one of the rare movies that I want to end despite its long duration. You don't understand how time passes. He is a legend with his successful acting, unforgettable lines and music you can't get enough of. Every look of Al Pacino in The Godfather has a story.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ShitizSays,10,5 October 2011,"Godfather needs no introduction as the name says it all. This movie in fact is godfather to all film makers and movie lovers. Right from the opening scene to the last scene, every scene is perfectly craved to make the movie the most perfect movie of all time and it well deserves all the awards it has got. I found Godfather very boring when I watched it first time as i was little and naive and needed more over do of everything in movies i watch. I watched it again some years later and i found it likable and hence with every re-watching i fell more in love with film and i started to notice the genius in it. The acting, the script, the music, the characters, the story, the screenplay, costumes, art, direction everything is just near perfect. Anyone who lived after 1972 has no chance of missing this magnum opus. We will be eternally grateful to Coppola for this masterpiece. A brave 10 on 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),camelpictures,10,16 January 2018,The originality of this movie till today fascinates me and there will never be one like it
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),melikeaygaz,10,28 November 2023,"""The best sequel in history, IMDb score of 9 points, the sequel to The Godfather adventure... Usually sequels are disappointing after the first film and are not much preferred by people, but The Godfather 2, on the contrary, was as successful as the first film, even the first film received 3 Oscars, but the second, that is, this film received 6 Oscars. It is also currently ranked third on IMDB after The Price of Captivity and the first film of The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola also used the time event of more than 3 hours in every film he made in this film and received the criticism of ""I'm bored because of the long time"" by some people. In fact, the time was so long that Coppola had to remove Fabrizio's death scene, Hyman Roth's identity will be revealed, and a few scenes of Vito Corleone and add them to special DVD sets. This film tells about how Michael Corleone rose in the criminal world and reached his father's power, Vito Corleone's life from childhood to youth, until he had children. In addition, Robert De Niro put on one of the most incredible performances in history and played the character of Vito Corleone as if Marlon Brando were playing the youth. Every movement is exactly the same, down to the behavior and even the way of scratching the face. As always, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall have shown exquisite acting. The past and future of the Corleone family take place in this film, there are also new faces and enemies in the film. It's like a Hyman Roth character. The Hyman Roth character will want to trick Michael and take everything he has and kill him, he will use a surprise in this, and you will experience a shock effect when you see this person. Although the film was shot only 2 years after the first film, that is, in 1974, it feels like it was shot 20 years later. With its music, fiction, screenplay and acting, lines, it is a masterpiece, a film that is at the top again as always."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),billstaxx,10,16 June 2023,"This was a great film it is a classic that everyone refers to. As part of Collider's ""retro review"" series, I've been fortunate enough to watch and review Penny Marshall's heartfelt tear-jerker A League of Their Own and Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful masterpiece Psycho, two very different, but very important films for any lover and admirer of cinema. But the title that inevitably rises to the top of all movie conversations is, of course, The Godfather. Usually, it involves someone's often cringe-worthy attempt at an impression of Vito Corleone saying those famous words: ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" (If only there was a way we could refuse to hear these impressions.) While that line of dialogue has been overstated, praise for the 1972 crime drama certainly has not."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),umarkhitabkhan,9,13 March 2017,"My childhood fantasy and dreamy experience to cinema. Its a great great crime drama i ever seen. This one is a best in trivia of Godfather. The all cast is mind blowing specially Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was superb. James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden and John Marley also was great."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joshuagroth-23734,10,6 June 2023,"""The Godfather"" (1972) is an incredible masterpiece with exceptional storytelling. It delves deep into the world of Mafia clans, depicting their lives with astonishing precision. The movie highlights how seemingly insignificant details can ignite intense conflicts and showcases the far-reaching consequences of power and influence. Marlon Brando delivers a mesmerizing performance as Vito Corleone, the formidable patriarch of the Corleone family. The narrative revolves around Vito's son, Michael (played by Al Pacino), who reluctantly enters the family's criminal empire and undergoes a remarkable transformation into a ruthless leader. The film is visually stunning, complemented by intense performances and a captivating storyline. It's a must-see classic that shines a light on the dark underbelly of the American Dream."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ruthiecrisafulli,10,11 July 2007,"I always thought that the godfather was kind of boring until I watched it this past year. I never fully grasped the idea of the mob. Also I couldn't get past the first half hour. But once I did I went on to watch the second and then the third one too. This movie is filled with drama, action and gore. If you love gun action and movies with deception you'll love how things play out in this movie. There isn't any comedy in my opinion only great sayings that stick with you and great scenes. If you have ever seen ""you've got mail"" and the godfather you'll know that if your a guy it is essential to see this movie. If you don't see it, you will be missing out on the best movie of all time."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),trubinskijdaniil,10,19 January 2022,"And yet I came to the conclusion that the godfather, the movie is very eternal, classic, inimitable, this movie belongs to those films that leave a trace, even your communion in it, thanks to the atmosphere created by the music of the Company, and the main Sicilian theme of Godfather, by the greatest actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton. I will not talk about the essence of the book or the movie, what it teaches us, in any case, everyone determines for himself what to take from this movie or book. The book, like the film, are not masterpieces of literature and cinema, they are outside the framework of this space, they have a separate place in the repository, as something special, personal, making you worry, sympathize, not understand, but admire every time. Times are changing, techniques and techniques are being improved, the picture is better, dynamic, films are being made about gangsters, about the underworld.

Michael Corleone as the main character in the GF is a rich and three-dimensional character who is principled in facing arcs throughout the story. There is an amazing flow in the storytelling of GF and the story world is very nicely well established. At the end of the story all the stories are well connected and there are answers for all questions established in the beginning of the story.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NICKAK413,10,24 February 2003,"The Godfather is without a doubt the Greatest Movie of our time and of anybody else's time. The brutally brilliant and passionate film is about the violent Mafia family, the Corleones. Don Vito Corleone (Best Actor Academy Award Winner Marlon Brando) is passing on the family business to one of his sons-but which one? He decides to skip over the oldest son, the hotheaded Santino (Academy Award Nominee James Caan); He also decides to skip over cowardly Frederico (John Cazale); In the end he passes it down to youngest son, the intelligent Michael (Academy Award Nominee Al Pacino). This movie won the Academy Award for best picture in 1972 and deservedly so. Great performances by Brando, Pacino, Cazale, Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Robert Duvall. It deserves to be the IMDB's highest rated film and #3 on the American Film Institute's Best List. It should be number 1. On a scale of one to ten, this gets a 100."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),double_l69,10,21 February 2005,"Wow! Ross And Ronnay in the Sunday papers will have their work cut out for them commenting on this film! It is the greatest film ever, just like Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and Shindlers List, it has mastered its genre, except many people do not know of the film!!! Now days movies such as oceans 11, Layer cake and even police investigative stories try to have the original concept of them film, with the moral battling of crime. The beauty of the story is that it is original and none of the actors (in the first part) were well known, which gives them an better on-screen identity, compared to modern day Hollywood heroes such as brad Pitt, Collin pharrel and Tom Cruise. Even action packed scarface can take The Godfathers title as 'Best Crime/Gangster Film Ever' because that is exactly what godfather is. Its only downfall is the conclusion of the saga, in part number three which is kind off like The Matrix trilogy in a way, The First part had a cult following, number 2 was ""good but will never beat the first"" and the third one was awful! The Godfather = legendary film, which will live long in existence especially with the Italian population! The only deteriorating factor is its lenght not many people can watch a film for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but i could :). Also the plot is tricky to understand for first time viewers!"

If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket.

They didn't even agreed with some of the shot and artistic vision he had for his film but and went on to do amazing things, breaking records ad setting new ones. It did great in the box office that year and it went on to become the greatest film of all time. Not only did the film inspired filmmakers like my self but it paved the way for Mafia films in general. Ironically Francis him self became in his own right a godfather in the world of Mafia film. I also enjoyed watching how the characters in the film changed towards the ending of the film.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oOoBarracuda,10,16 January 2018,"Watching The Godfather is an event. Clocking in at five minutes shy of three hours and having some of the most epochal dialogue in the history of film, watching The Godfather is taking part in something that has forever changed the landscape of cinema. Mario Puzo's novel that he himself helped adapt into the 1972 film by Francis Ford Coppola offered a groundbreaking insight into the world of an organized crime dynasty. Highlighting the human beings associated with such death and destruction certainly took audiences by storm in the early 70's, and continues to do so today. Seeing the origin of where a number of cinema's most iconic lines came from is a truly magnificent journey, and one certainly worth the three-hour investment. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pushkaranand007,10,10 January 2022,"A Golden Era movie. Have been a die-hard fan of the entire series... There has been a little i can add to the reviews. Have seen many superb movies, but this is one is surely the every green Golden era movies. It keeps you connected."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),martinpersson97,9,23 June 2020,"This film, based on the legendary book by author Mario Puzo, is a prime example of movie making and the potential of Hollywood-flicks."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kmcanerney_2016,10,27 March 2016,"I am not going to tell you why I think this film is great. There are very few films that have been discussed so intently as this one (Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the only two that come to mind that might be more respected) and there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Also, I'm not going to try and change your mind, it's probably already set and if you are anything like me, it's not changing anytime soon. Besides, film is art not science and art is about emotion. No movie has meant as much to me as The Godfather, let me tell you why. I think I got hooked on movies because I am an obsessive person. If I read a good book I must read ALL of the authors work--two days into The Road, I had ordered McCarthy's other nine books. Everybody loves movies. I bet one in three adults hasn't touched a book in over a year but most of us make our pilgrimage to the local multiplex at least once every month or two and there are a handful of movies--whether they be Citizen Kane and 400 blows or Die Hard and The Rock--that we'll watch whenever they're on TV. At eleven or twelve, I certainly had my list of favorites but most of them were simply entertaining. I've since learned to appreciate Raiders of the Lost Ark as a piece of film making and ET as a genuinely brilliant work of art (its one of those movies you loved as a kid but love even more as an adult) but the Godfather was really the first movie that blew me a way. I may not have been able to tell you why but even back then i could tell, this was something special, this was a work of art. This film, along with its sequel (I like to think of them as one movie, mainly so I don't have to pick a favorite) Have topped my list of all time favorites for as long as I care to remember. Often I've wondered if its simply because of how strong my initial reaction was after that first viewing but every time I re watch it, from the beginning or starting in the middle, I'm reassured that it truly is the greatest film of all time. 'I believe in America,' still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, right down to the final scene when they close the door. The baptism is one of the greatest scenes in cinema, or is it the one at the toll booth, or at the wedding, or in the restaurant. There are too many. It is a film that doesn't just work at every level, it works perfectly at every level. If you have not seen this film you cannot say you love movies. American cinema may not have began here but every film since has been made in its shadow. It is the greatest film of all time and will never be topped, Period."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),five40four,9,21 August 2023,"The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly weaves a tale of power, family, and loyalty. Marlon Brando's portrayal is captivating, exuding authority and complexity. The film's slow-burning tension draws you into the morally intricate world of the Mafia. It's impeccable storytelling and iconic scenes, like the horse head in the bed, have left an indelible mark on pop culture. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is flawless, and the ensemble cast delivers unforgettable performances. With its compelling characters and exploration of the consequences of one's choices, The Godfather remains a timeless classic that deserves every bit of its acclaim."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sangafolla,10,14 March 2022,Such an iconic piece of art .It's like classic Italian mob documentary narrated by the people within the story. Totally understood the enormous pressure during the production of this film as it's realism nature eventually changed how movies are made.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Shahamat,10,24 March 2005,"Now as I think, what to write about 'The Godfather' a thousand brilliant perspectives flash in my mind. Should I marvel at the mesmerizing story that surrounds you ever so sweetly or should I wonder about strong undertones which reveal themselves like shooting starts. Should I admire the vivid visualization of the dream or should I talk about the truth that emerges from it. Godfather might be a great movie to others but to me it is a journey through human mind, candid and knowing. The motives of a man and the eternal conflict with direction. All that is said about 'good', reveals itself in the story of this bad man. I am a fan of Vito Carlione, he is wise, he is respectful, he is a true capitalist. He is not bad himself but does not mind employing bad means. After all, some body has got to do the exploration. I can't say how thankful I am to people who made this movie for not spoiling my imagination. A truth well told is the biggest achievement."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),curena1,9,19 September 2001,"This film has  become an instant classic and my second favourite film surpassed only by its sequel which is a rare portrait of an American masterpiece and fine art. The cast of Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall, Cazale, Keaton, Shire, Castellano, Conte, Marley, and Martino are unsurpassed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DannytheHippie,10,12 June 2002,"The Godfather is a true definition of great filmaking.  Unbelieveable acting by Marlon Brando, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, and of course Al Pacino. The story itself is unlike any other I have ever seen.  Landmark! Simply Landmark!  It really invented a new genre of Mafia films.  Often copyed never duplicated, except its sequel The Godfather Part II."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Vishalthakkarofficial,9,18 September 2022,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dricardopereira,10,11 May 2016,"This is my all time favorite movie and when people ask me why it is my favorite movie,always tell them the same reasons. The characters are amazing some of my all time favorite characters Vito Corleone and his son Michael Corleone are some of the most iconic memorable and interesting characters of all time, the acting in this movie is perfect from every cast member even smaller roles are incredible well acted, i still don't understand how Al Pacino never won an Oscar for his role in these movies. The story is incredible, unpredictable unique and interesting, and for a movie over 40 years old, its steal amazing the story arc and feelings of the characters, it as aged incredible well. The director Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job, its incredible well directed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cristianojrcosta,10,18 April 2014,"""The Godfather"" is much more than a story about gangsters and based on the novel by Mario Puzo mob. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful in the art of film and endowed with a classical virtuosity inspired, serves up the organization and the intrigues of the crime society to conceive of a true epic about family and about the evolution of family values ​​during the twentieth century. Incidentally, ""The Godfather"" is perhaps the first major cinematic chronicle of the twentieth century on the family's own twentieth century. It is a kind of self-analysis; an exercise that the time has come to prove as extraordinary.Just simple saying... watch the movie... one of the best ever produce..."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NotCreativeAtAll,10,18 March 2020,It's The Godfather ffs. From all the crime movies this one is the best imo.And it surely deserves 10.Everything is amazing from story to characters.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shaqdune,9,10 September 2014,"This movie was impeccable. It showed great cinematography, and the acting was superb. The suspense was carried throughout the film with heart beating, wrenching music that matched beautifully with the scene's setting. The character of Don Corleone makes the audience feel less than him due to his superiority he portrays in the film. I highly recommend this movie to everybody, even if you do not enjoy mafia movies. The reason why it did not receive a 10 is due to the duration of the film's storyline. I just felt it ran a little too slow for my taste, but besides that, it is an amazing film comprised with outstanding performances in all film aspects."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),leotraktor,10,20 April 2023,"I trully cannot express with only 600 hundred words how fresh this movie feels ive been watching a lot of movies latley but this steps it up one notch. The godfather has everything cute elements sad elements shocking elements and suprising elements lets say when sonny got lit up i didnt expect it but i somehow seen it coming also when don vito corleone died i could have forseen it but i chose not to and to just enjoy the cute moment beetwen him and his grandson. Another shocking element is micheals change,at the start he was a normal man who wanted to take revenge on the men who almost killed don vito but at the end you can see his ruthlessnes when he kills carlo. I truly love this movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zenismith,10,10 January 2023,"The Godfather is an American classic and an iconic film that has stood the test of time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. The story focuses on a powerful mafia family in New York City and their struggles to maintain control over their business empire. The film features some of the best performances in cinema history from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, as well as an excellent supporting cast. The direction is masterful and the film's score is legendary. The Godfather is an unforgettable movie that should be watched and enjoyed by all."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samueltugues,10,29 June 2005,"The Godfather: A movie without anything that needs to be changed. Indeed, when one sees the godfather, one doesn't have anything to criticize it. Their script is perfect, in fact, for me is one of the best screenplay ever written; the performances and the direction are also perfect: The performances are really wonderful, especially Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, accompanied with a marvelous cast; and the direction is amazing. Equally, the soundtrack, the decorations, the wardrobe and all that conforms the movie, is perfect; anything is in its place. The master sum in all their components, make The godfather an immortal and unforgettable movie. A master piece. An entire cinematographic lesson."

Thank you
Francis Ford Coppola"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bnm81510,10,20 April 1999,"This epic of epics, in my wholehearted view, remains to this day America's  most accomplished feature film. Even without understanding the dialogue's nuances or the storyline's elaborate twists, one is still inexorably drawn to the movie, as I found myself to be since the earliest time. What makes it so enormously appealing and deeply satisfying is Copolla's masterful direction. Every frame is constructed in such an ingenious manner, that if taken out of context and hung up on a wall as a painting, it would take up another value, becoming as work of art in and of itself. Indeed, it is tempting to compare the dark indoor compositions (the mise-en-scenes' arrangement especially) to Rembrandt and other Dutch masters, without exaggeration. The staging of each scene is handled with the kind of technical and spiritual balance advocated only in Eastern religions: no extreme close-ups, no jittery or stale camera movements. On a visual level, ""The Godfather"" possesses an ethereal beauty regardless of content. The picture's other aspects reveal an astounding proximity to irrefutable perfection: an immortal original score with at least three distinguished motifs; the superlative acting by all of the Corleone Mafia clan and their enemies; the compelling plot which swiftly unfolds before us through, among other things, the most riveting montage since ""Battleship Potemkin"", no less. Even its minute details are widely quoted today: what comes most easily to mind is the shot-by-shot parody of Brando's botched assassination in '99's ""Analyze This"", and the more obscure slang term : ""to pull a Fredo"", coined  in ""Swingers"" (one of the 90's hippest comedies). Just to decipher the later (decidedly dirty) reference should be a good excuse to watch ""The Godfather"" yet again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kavinps,9,10 February 2009,"The Godfather has to be one of the most masterful and perfect films of all time. Francis Ford Coppola does a great job in directing by creating great suspense and drama in the film as well as the dark theme meant in the book. Mario Puzo did a wonderful job in turning his best-selling book into a movie script with a little help from Coppola. This film also introduces some of the greatest actors in the crime genre which includes great performances by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. The beginning of the film is the only part that I hated because it was so long and boring too but I guess there was probably no other way to begin the movie I guess. I like how they show a lot of the Italian and mafia culture in the film but they do tend to mistake a lot of mob culture. First of I looked at the film and the guys don't ever talk like mob guys. In the real mafia everyone curse including the higher ranking and elder bosses. I surprised by the lack of profanity in the movie and I think the only I time I ever heard a curse word is when Sonny said the ""N"" word at the dinner table which I have no clue why he said it because it was so random. Also they get rid of a lot of power away from the Captains of the capo-regimes. I never heard much talk of the business from Tessio or Clemenza which is really is out of the mob ranking style. Also despite this being a great mafia movie they don't make the mobsters cruel enough. I mean come on we all know that these guys are monsters and murderers make them look that rather than some fat guys who are rich and love eating cake. Well one thing they did get right was the asking favors thing with the Don and screw him for not getting into drugs. Overall I'll recommend this movie to anyone but please don't judge by the boring beginning please see the whole movie before you judge it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kupigavna,10,1 April 2018,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."

Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented Laurence Olivier in terms of esteem. Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented Laurence Olivier in terms of esteem. Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando."

But when I finally did, OMG I'm mad at myself for not giving it a chance. Like another reviewer said, you see something new every time you watch it. I could watch this movie every day. I appreciate the snapshot into a world that I will never live in. The plot is rich and all of the characters are very well developed."

Superb cast, all the actors played their characters convincingly and with authority. Some people may find the length of the film too long but in my opinion there isn't a dull moment. This film is both classy and brutal at the same time and nothing and nobody should turn down an offer they cannot refuse. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brandon.holscher,10,22 December 2000,"Along with it's sequel, Godfather II, this movie is what American movies should aspire to.  Great acting, great story line.  The power of the family, the immigrants' rise to glory, the failures of society, the paradox of religion and violence woven together to form the perfect movie.  The characters are composites of real men and women in history.  The scenes fictionalize real historical events.  The Don's granting wishes to his neighbors remind you of Marranzano's despotic rule in the early 30's. The shooting in the restaurant mirrors Luciano's assassination of Masseria. Moe Green's execution is really Bugsy Segal's.  The climax is the night of the Sicilian Vespers.  This film is a classic.  Puzo's work is wonderful and Coppola's vision is perfect."

Is spite of the fact that I rarely like to watch a movie more than once every five years, whenever I am flipping through the channels on cable, and I come across this movie I am always compelled to stop and watch. Regardless of what I had planned to do seldom do I get up before the movie is over."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),StrugglesWithResearch,9,2 March 2006,"I can't count the times I've seen the Godfather. I can't count the times I've read books about the movie. I can't say how much I regret not having found the time to read Mario Puzo's book. The Godfather is a story about a king and his three sons. And the sons all fight for power one way or another. The succession of the kingdom is the absolute reward for some and the absolute curse for others. There is something utterly seductive about the lighting of the movie, the stories (from the main stories to the secondary characters), about the ongoing feeling that danger lies around the corner, that this life is never safe and that you must, as popular Italian culture suggests, do everything for the family. ""In my youngest and more vulnerable years"" I wrote an essay about the role/position of women in the Godfather. I wrote about the flaws of the Godfather, about how, because it was filmed from the side of the family, you couldn't see the illegitimate character of the Corleone family's work. I wrote about the misogynist approaches and the utterly patriarchal viewpoints of the movie. I wrote about the inherent racism towards other ethnic minorities. But I still can't escape the spell. I still can't believe this feeling when Michael goes to the hospital to see Vito and he protects his father as is in his imaginative nature. There are so many moments in the Godfather that make me shiver. There's so much magic in the trilogy."

This is a perfect 10 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scutarian,10,18 April 2004,"Actually,there are few words left for me to comment on and praise the first film of the godfather trilogy.As a person who read Mario Puzo's best-seller novel, I can tell that the story is perfectly put into the movie scenario with all the scenes having grave importance.Secondly,all characters of the film,including side roles as well as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino perform a tremendous play.For example James Caan(one of my favourite actors), aka Sonny , fits very well with all his manners,looks the quicktempered, hot casanova mafia image.Besides these, the scenario is realistic and dramatic in terms of an inside picture of an Italian mafia family with all the cosa nostra traditions of 40's and before.This movie has created its mottos(an offer you can't refuse) , stable characters(I even do not have the right to criticize Marlon Brando and Al Pacino)  and unforgettable scenes.With this property this movie is the pioneer of all the other mafia tragedies and dramas."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheOneThatYouWanted,10,12 August 2017,"What can I say? This is easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just because the acting and everything is on point, but because Brando pushes it over the edge. There is no argument about it, Marlon Brando is the greatest actor of all time, and not just because of what he does in this film but for nearly every film he has been in. And his later films are all the better because at that point, he more or less mastered his craft. But yeah, The Godfather is an excellent film. The secret behind it, other than Brando's acting is the story. It isn't a crime story but a tale about a family; most people can not wrap their heads around such a concept."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),denis_bayer,10,19 December 2016,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ankurpajni,10,17 September 2017,"A perfect gem in the movie history, a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The Godfather portrays inner world of the Italian mafia - there are no fancy moments, no glittering hysterics of gangsters it shines from the creeks of the kitchen and dining room, impressive performances, timeless lighting and engrossing editing makes this a masterpiece, A must watch for all the movie buffs."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aknik-37360,10,19 January 2022,"Brilliant cinematography, sparkling against the backdrop of dull everyday films, a brilliant movie that won its Oscars for a reason, but deserved more statuettes, everything is wonderful in it - from music to titles, a great masterpiece!!! Puzo, the genius of the pen... Did you believe it? Of course, our admiration is the last thing, and of course their color is insincere. Casual readers care little about epithets, because there are no laudatory exclamations; we are primarily interested in analyzing the film and its characters. Fasten seat belts."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),immunezone,10,7 February 2016,"It is rare when when a film can tell so many diverse and interconnected stories all at once. Powerful performances, golden directing, and a perfect script that all contribute to The Godfather's fame in the world of films. This is not a bang bang boom slapped together type film to stuff the appetite of the average movie goers; it was carefully and perfectly crafted in every way imaginable. Conventional wisdom did not influence this films director, Francis Ford Coppola's vision is original in every way. This film is the alpha and omega of all films ever shot! Nothing will ever compare. I mean no other film can touch this. The acting is superb from the whole cast. Marlon Brando's part is vital for this film, his character is the soul of this masterpiece."

Such as when Michael is at the restaurant with Sollozzo and the commissioner. The moment is very tense, there is no music. The sounds of a train stopping ramp up in volume right before he shoots Sollozzo and the cop. Leave the gun, take the canoli."

The dialogues are outstanding. The story is captivating. And the performances are extraordinary. Michael Corleone's transformation is quite riveting. Al Pacino was wonderful. Marlon Brando is also amazing as Don Corleone. The film was slow in some aspects but overall it was an incredible film."

I watched this movie for the first time in a films class I've been taking. The God Father opens with a man talking to the god father about some services. This scene has ""low key"" lighting the lighting is very dim, to show you that this is an important scene and that the god father and his client mean business. I rated The God Father 9 out of 10 because it is an outstanding movie, and keeps you guessing, even though after one thing happens you know what's going to happen next. The audiences reaches a big turn in the movie, when the god father is shot, after he's shot, his family believes he's dead. A family being apart of a mob, always calls for revenge. This movie is great and I definitely recommend it."

It is the most perfect one for me. It has action, it has best actors and actresses, it has an interesting plot and most importantly it has very deep meaning in it. and every time you watch this, every time you understand more and more deeply go to the atmosphere of how the life was in Sicily at that times.
Also I think that another reason that I like this movie so much is because of my personal preference. I like al Pachino first of all and watch all his films which a great pleasure and also I like the Italian mafia theme very much."

""The godfather"" is also very successful, but ""the godfather"" mainly depicts a few characters, the old generation of godfather calm, calm, deep eyes, with a vague tone about the dignity of men, ""I will make him an offer he can't refuse"" let me have a deep respect for this role. Another mission portrays sonny, the older godfather's eldest son, who is hot-tempered and bent on revenge after his father is shot. In one role is the godfather's youngest son, the second generation godfather mike Stoic, profound. Compared to his father, the old godfather was a majestic lion, and mike was a lonesome Wolf. Not much was said about the other two because of his admiration for the old godfather. But there is no doubt that their portrayal is extremely successful."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hooma814,8,23 February 2020,"The Godfather! Known as the best movie of all time. That's about as high as the bar can be set, I think something like this will always disappoint when the bar is that high. Was it a great movie? Yes. Was it the best movie I've ever seen? No. Thankfully it reminded me that movies cannot actually provide as any sense of true purpose, real meaning, or long lasting satisfaction. They're an escape. This movie helped me to remember that movies alone cannot show me who I really am. It can educate and show new perspectives, and show part of who we are, or we can feel happy for a while, but this never lasts. If the best movie ever made couldn't do it then surely no movie can. I'd held out so long for watching this movie, always seeing it at the top of IMDB lists and imagining how good it must be, when it easily beats some of my all time favourites. But at the end of the day its just another movie. Worth watching. Not worth putting all your hope into of being the pincale of movie making. Great acting, great story though. It felt so authentic, very fresh and unlike movies that are made today. Sad that many western cultures today do not have such a strong sense of family and tradition - although in saying that this family and its traditions are not something I would want any part to do with."

Or about the terrible performance of the actors, especially the performance of Marlon Brando. It is a performance from another world. I liked the movie very much.

And of course my mind has never changed, the movie is almost always flawless with a super cool opening scene. We lived through the moments of the mafia's life from conflict, revenge, and everything, whether negative or negative.
This is without forgetting the scenario and directing, as well as the performance of the legendary actors, especially by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. For me, there are some lapses that are not very impressive, which I will not mention in order to avoid them Spoilers"

The Godfather set the benchmark for so many mafia films to follow but till now it can not be rivaled for it's excellence in almost every department .Whether it's is the brillant performances , enchanting background score by Nino Rota and of course great direction by Francis Ford Coppola .I had heard of this movie when i was a kid , but with no interest in watching it , but on a sunday night H.B.O.(the indian version ) telecast this movie and i was hooked . Perhaps not knowing how successful this movie was helped , i watched the movie  without knowing it 's background or having read Mario Puzo's bestselling book . Instead i happen to see the Last Don before seeing this movie . The movie haunts you long after u have finished seeing it whether it 's the godfather theme or Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's ground - breaking performances ( who could he lose to at the oscars in the best supporting actor category ? ) ."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),young_jo,10,6 April 2007,"I sometimes wish I was alive in 1972 so I could see The Godfather in theaters. Some of the best cinematography and editing was produced in this movie. It tells the story of the mafia from the inside. It was amazing how the movie made you admire Don Corleone even though he was essentially evil. During the movie, the audience really doesn't see much it can disapprove of. No women are involved in prostitution, no lives are being ended by compulsive gambling, and no theft rings. In fact, the only real person outside the mob who is corrupt is a police officer with a significant speaking role. Brando is great with many memorable and quotable lines, and Al Pacino's performance in comparison to Brando's shouldn't be ranked to much further behind. A great ensemble of a cast and supporting players. Well done!"

Movie Review
On the whole, The Godfather is an extremly impressive thriller, narrated in a sensible manner. One of the best movies I have ever reviewed. Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather,"" is a masterpiece.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bleakeye,10,14 February 2001,"A favorite by so many people in the world, Mario Puzo's The Godfather is considered by many, including myself, to be the greatest accomplishment in the history of cinema.  Director Francis Ford Coppola has masterfully visualized the ambience and power of the novel.  Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and the rest of the cast has brought to life one of the most acclaimed film of all time.  The popularity of this film is not surprising because it contains memorable music, moving scenes, thought provoking dialogue/phrases and extraordinary acting by an extraordinary cast.  At the risk of sounding redundant, which in the case of giving thoughts about this movie is a given, it is so much more than what it seems storywise.  If I try to even explain this aspect of the movie, I'd lose myself.  This film is important to so many people that I recommend it to anyone that haven't seen it (which are some very unlucky people I might add).  Unfortunately, no simple explanation could ever compensate for the experience of watching Don Vito Corleone and His Family's Tale of Crime and Family.  In conclusion, I wish to say that everybody should see it for themselves and be enlightened to what could be a wonderful journey and learning experience."

I could feel my 1/4 Italien ancestry really come out of me during this film; it made me mew so much that I got lockjaw. Another thing I liked about it is that I remembered who the Godfather was. Do you know who is the Godfather? It's the Godfather! Yeah yeah, thats the Godfather alright! Look at um', he really is the Godfather! No way, is that the Godfather from the hit movie The Godfather (1972)?! That certainly was a The Godfather moment right there!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zerrinashita,10,13 October 2023,"""The Godfather"" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. From its compelling narrative to its flawless execution, this film stands as a timeless work of art. It's no exaggeration to say that it deserves every bit of its perfect 10/10 rating. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of remarkable. His vision and ability to bring Puzo's story to life is unparalleled. The film's pacing is perfect, and every scene is a masterclass in filmmaking. Coppola's keen eye for detail and his ability to draw out brilliant performances from his cast are evident throughout. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone is legendary, and he rightfully earned an Academy Award for his role. Al Pacino's transformation from an innocent bystander to a ruthless patriarch is a tour de force. Gordon Willis's cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, with its signature dark, moody lighting that perfectly matches the film's tone. The film's score, composed by Nino Rota, is haunting and iconic, setting the mood for every scene.""The Godfather"" revolutionized cinema. It set the standard for the modern gangster film and influenced countless directors and writers. Its memorable quotes, unforgettable scenes, and enduring legacy continue to captivate audiences to this day. Beyond the crime saga, ""The Godfather"" delves into themes of family, power, corruption, and the American Dream. The symbolism, such as the use of oranges and the famous baptism scene, adds depth to the narrative. Even decades after its release, ""The Godfather"" remains culturally relevant. Its themes continue to resonate, and its lessons about the corrupting nature of power are as vital as ever."

The Godfather is just timeless, with such pitch perfect performances, cinematography, direction, editing, music, production design, sound design... the list goes on. This film and its sequel is the high water mark of American cinema in the latter half of the 20th century,"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cinemattic-69420,10,19 March 2024,"I'd like to preface this by acknowledging that my rating does somewhat reinforce the male stereotype pointed out in Greta Gerwig's Barbie. But there just is something that men find fascinating about this franchise. My introduction to this movie itself comes from a close friend of mine's enthusiasm for the movie, I will come back to the meaning the movie has to men. I was not very familiar with Francis Ford Coppola's work but this movie has pointed out to me that this may very much have been a mistake. The very first scene, caught my eye from a directing standpoint, the slow zooming out whilst Bonasera explains his situation to the Don Corleone makes it very clear the influence and power that the godfather has. And accompanying this filming prowess throughout, is an absolutely beautiful score that well deserved its withdrawn Academy Award. The touches of Italian culture throughout the movie almost makes me long for Italian heritage, which is an homage to how beautifully it was implemented in the film. The acting in this film is near flawless and makes the viewing immersive, I found myself rooting for the Corleone family almost as if I were part of it. Marlon Brando's presence on screen, as always, is marvelous. To add to that, Al Pacino's depiction of Micheal Corleone's character development is frictionless and coherent with the events that happen throughout. Talia Shire's performance translates perfectly the emotions Connie would be feeling especially when she confronts her brother. I could go on and on about the brilliant show of acting in this movie, but I want to focus on the meaning the film has. I am but a sub-par movie reviewer and most likely will not have picked up on any ground-breaking imagery never before highlighted, but I am here to talk about why this movie speaks to men in a way few pieces of art do. Micheal Corleone start his life somewhat distancing himself from his family's business due to his different moral compass, something many can relate to, it can be very easy to look at others lives and think we would act differently given the chance, and similarly, young men may start their lives thinking they have a perfect record. But there comes a time when we have to step up, when duty comes knocking at the door, you may have no choice but to answer. When the Sollozzo tried to have Vito killed, Micheal had no choice but to step up and organise to have his father avenged. It is this acceptance of current situations which makes him become the man he is at the end of the movie. You will be challenged in life, and when you do, you must take matters into your own hands, you can try to make excuses, you can try to blame it on other factors but eventually you will have to come to terms with the fact that things are the way they are and it is only up to you to change them. There are many notable quotes about family in this movie, ""A man who doesn't spend time with family, can never be a real man."" - Vito Corleone, ""Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again."" - Vito Corleone, ""Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever."" - Micheal Corleone. Which all partly summarise a broader message that blood is thicker than water, no questions asked. Men resonate with that message for their own personal reasons, but one thing they almost all have in common, they will, for the most part, be fathers of children, husbands of wives and godfather to godsons and for some, the don of their extended family too. All of these commitments connect to legacy and continuity beyond their own life, and for that commitment to not go in vain, there must be a passed down value which prioritises family, always. Words to live by."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mohammadmsj,10,11 August 2020,"One of the best if not the best movie ever
amazing piece of art"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),peter-07994,9,16 July 2015,"The godfather was my first introduction to the organization and rules behind the Italian mafia. Only after that I started to see how this was crucial to success of a criminal organization. Sculpted like and inspired by the Roman empire is a method that really worked. It changed somewhat during the years, but my empire is still run in a similar way."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Miazole,10,19 April 2021,"Legendary performances that remain some of the best ever given from an all-star cast, iconic cinematography, and some of the absolute best, most human character development that ever made its way to a screen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JoshuatheFilmNerd,10,7 November 2013,"The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. It's perfect, or at least close to perfection. It is obviously overrated, but there's a reason it's like that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yujian-52768,10,11 June 2024,"I have to say that there is no movie to watch, even godfather. However, when you have to shut your mouth, because no one wants to hear it, you have to dry your blood and tears, because no one cares, at this time, go and see godfather, because he is worth it. If you want to find a movie to witness your life and eliminate your nothingness, then choose godfather, because it is worth it. People all say that Godfather is the ""Man's Bible"" that men must read, but I can't tell my father this evaluation, and how childish and ridiculous it is to say it. Taking godfather as a necessity for men or a shortcut for men is actually not praising this movie, but belittling it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),grzegorz-26796,10,31 March 2018,Absolute masterpiece. A film that taught me that it is worth taking care of my honor and dignity. It is also worth being humble.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),londondirectory,10,4 April 2020,"Yes this movie is so great. This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),z-72185,10,1 November 2021,", I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),q-27562,9,19 March 2020,"Male growth movie, telling the story of a child becoming a gangster boss, this is the best gangster crime movie I have ever seen, which is very shocking."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Richerthanmusk,10,8 June 2022,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),slashhserbia,10,13 November 2016,Beautiful movie that will last throughout time.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amipanda,10,21 August 2023,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imonahesxxa,9,21 April 2021,This film will always be a classic to me. Best acting and a quality production.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sarkar_adit,10,20 December 2006,"What can I say about this masterpiece. Few words can describe The Godfather. This film is an excellent adaptation of the best seller novel. I have read the book and seen the film. I loved both, though the book is better since it gives more insight into the Italian mafia. But the movie is great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),IshvinderMaddh,10,7 October 2019,"The Godfather is an absolute classic, which is definitely a required watch for anyone looking to create an action thriller. One of my most favourite movies of all times."

This a movie I can watch over and over again. I recommend this movie. Although the movie is about gangsters, there's still a lesson to be learned from this movie. There is a price to pay for being a criminal. Every good dog has its good and bad days."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BN98is,10,22 September 2019,"This is great movie
Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thealiev,10,15 December 2018,"I watched it when I was 13 years old. No one asked me to do so. I loved it and kept watching it for 30 times in 30 days. I have a top ten list, The Godfather 1972 is out of the list. On the top. Nothing can come close to it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mfellipecampos,10,21 May 2020,"A realistic and shocking portrait of how the mafia acted in the 1940s. A priceless masterpiece. Marlon Brando in a perfect performance, leaving a mark in cinema as one of the most respected and acclaimed characters by the public and critics."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),HaMa_Cr0w,10,6 September 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as one of the greatest films ever made in the history of cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, this epic crime drama is not just a movie; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the world of film and storytelling. Based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, ""The Godfather"" transcends the boundaries of its genre, offering a profound exploration of power, family, loyalty, and the consequences of one's choices."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),josephjaxson,10,6 October 2018,This is the best movie I watched in my life. It has no mistakes
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mattghatte,10,29 May 2001,"This is what movies are all about, a great cast, wonderful performances, intresting characters, stand out scenes,lovely score and a great story all into one. The film may be 3 hours long but the film is always watchable and never boring, and it does not feel like 3 hours long. This is the only film out of the three that the whole family is together, which makes it easily the best.The scenes that stand out are the horses head(of course), sonnys shooting, vitos last breaths,and the five killings at the end. I dont know what it is but the film and the other two  are never the same when sonny dies, apart from vito ,sonny is by far the most interesting character of the all the films even more than michael, i only wish he lived a little longer. Michael is never the same man when his brother dies, and never likeable again until the end of part 3.The last hour is all about michael,about being the new leader. Something which surprised me was that vitos character has long spells when he is not in the film, michaels probally in the film more and pacino should have won an academy award with brando. Is brando really an actor, the guy is so good, there has never been a better actor ever.My fav scenes are the ones where michael is in italy, they really are moving and lovely. This is the best film ever, no doubt"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oscarbecerril,10,19 April 2018,"The structure of this story represents the development of the characters, their arc and how the objectives and super-objectives of each are linked with the universe of the story and also as a consequence of each."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),uzunmetraj,9,18 February 2018,"The Godfather is a great movie that innovated the crime genre. It has a great story which (for a nearly 3 hour movie) moves quickly. We are brought close to the professional and personal lives of these mafia men, and when we see some of them gunned down, it's relatively hard-hitting. This was an innovation at the time: for a mafia film to bring us emotionally close to the characters. Perhaps the most shocking scene in the film (not to spoil anything) ends with a car riddled in machine gun bullets. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone can be seen as one of the most iconic performances/roles in film history: it is Brando transformed, and he's fun to quote back to. Like any movie that is labeled with such a ""legendary"" status, The Godfather is a tad overrated; but still very good nonetheless thanks to it's great story, performances, and iconic scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salvatopheraivums,10,24 September 2018,"This is the best film action ever guys, do'nt forget to watch this film"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lihaozhou,10,3 May 2020,"I heard about ""The Godfather"" a long time ago. But the reason I watched it for the first time is because of my English conversation class. My teacher is crazy about it. He asked us to write a movie thesis.
The story itself is very exciting.
But as a movie, to turn this story into a legend, you need a team of extraordinary play.
Marlon Brando, as a veteran actor, blended the two roles of father and godfather very well, and very natural. His first appearance in the movie has completely conquered the audience. He is a unique godfather.
Director: Francis Ford Coppola also arranged the story very well. Although this is a very long movie, I have no fatigue at all. The climax and calm of the story have very good rhythm and regularity.
Music is also iconic. You may forget it briefly, but when you hear it again, you will immediately know it is ""The Godfather""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EviArgyriou,9,15 October 2020,"Masterpiece
Brilliant acting
Great storytelling
Inspiration to all generations"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amirhossein-makouei,9,27 March 2019,"The best movie ever made in this genre. Among these three, the first part of the film was better than all of them. The brilliant performance of Brando and Pacino was one of the best."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),l-59417,8,22 June 2020,"Gentle rhythm contains huge authority and tension, music slow light sadness, interests game human conflict. Whether acting or lens, the use of music, give a person with a kind of beauty to enjoy. Watching this film is extremely need to sink down to savor, but also whenever you turn it over to relive can have a new feeling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ierdembayar,10,17 September 2019,It's the Mona Lisa of the films and cult film that never will be old. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino adopt their role and they've contributed to the art to the that cinema era.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),info-14599-78165,10,19 February 2016,"Best film ever, amazing cast, Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation. The Godfather simultaneously along many roads: the socio-political analysis (the corruption of the authorities to the Cuban revolution), the Bildungsroman, the traditional gangster film, the protest film (especially in the third chapter), then go back where he started, more and more dark and bitter, closing in on itself. In full respect of the rules of tragedy, from the ancient Greeks to the New Hollywood. Ambassador of narrative classicism tinged cinefilia and spiced with personal experiences of its director, fascination with corruption and violence as inherent in the construction of power factors of both a family and a nation, conjunction of talents in adverse conditions with successful results and unexpected, the proof that even in the most unexpected place can wait a stainless classic, the Godfather is all that and the opportunity to see this in a movie theatre is a pending issue that many viewers or not viewers should have fulfilled."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mjnanakar,10,21 October 2022,"The Godfather movie has been reviewed from different perspectives and maybe this work of art is considered one of the masterpieces of cinema, but what has attracted my attention is the Godfather's business! An attractive idea with a business plan and a unique operational plan to create wealth and provide business security in innovative and new ways so that it can be inspired as a unique model for business development, how to manage members The group, keeping trade secrets, market development, audience analysis and how to deal with the law and interacting with society are only part of these issues that can be carefully considered, so I suggest you watch this movie from this angle."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jefj1_99,10,20 March 2001,"It;s either ""Boring and far too long"" or ""The best film ever!"". The crucial factor in these two opinions of 'The Godfather' is...intelligence. The Godfather is an intricate, clever, brilliantly scripted movie. Those of us who have the brains to understand it see its beauty, those who dont, cant. Its only downfall is that it is possibly too clever for all to enjoy which is a shame."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),musicalshubh0000,10,24 August 2017,"Movie is all awesome and having a many good scenes which are also so much impressing, where ever other are just making the same thing and going or repeating again and again but this is what I call movie. Even every single is having a good quality of new moves and that makes your movie different from other creations. Keep going on and bring us a lots of good innovative ideas."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zobairifty,9,10 June 2021,An amazing piece of work. The first time I saw the movie I couldn't but realize how the character was studied. This should be a subject of great interest to the filmmakers today because you don't get to see this kind of work.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elrond100,9,24 November 2003,"I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but you've already knew it deep inside of you. IT ISN'T THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES !! Yeah, I agree, the story is complex, the acting is outstanding, but all in all it's a proper 8 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),momjessicaandjordan,10,8 July 2021,This movie was fantastic. I see why people call GodFather one of the greatest films of all time. This is one of those movies that just feel so real. I see a lot of other mafia films trying to use this kinda of style but GodFather is on another level. I applaud👋👋
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maxtallica,10,10 May 2017,"Undoubtedly a cinematographic work, represents each character in an imperious way and the drama of the film is backed by an excellent script. With an exquisite cinematic direction making of the film an almost perfect semiotic and narrative composition. Francis Ford Coppola tells us the importance and honor of the Corleone family and its consequences of betrayal in business. The family, business, advice and decisions are the saucer that offers us this great film that despite the years that have passed continues and will remain a classic cult film, recommended in its entirety by filmmakers of all genres."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stathisvoukelatos,9,13 November 2010,"Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest directors of all time,have made many classic movies but i think that it is very difficult to find another movie made by him or by some also great director that can reach the literally unprecedented greatness of this film.This movie is perfect on every aspect:one-of-a-kind direction,superb acting,flawless plot and probably the best soundtrack ever used in a movie.Also the Godfather is a very touching and emotional movie,has a lot to do with the human mourn and the ensuing revenges that never ever end,furthermore it is about human relationships,greed for power,loyalty,devotion and respect.To sum up The Godfather is one of the few and far between true flawless masterpieces of all time and if you want to consider yourself an avid film-watcher,you have to watch it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),timothy_480,10,16 April 2007,Some day and that day may never come i'll call upon you to do a service for me but until that day accept this justice as a gift on my daughters wedding day. (Don Corleone) If you put the Godfather in front of me two years ago i would have told you to get lost. I never watched the film until a year ago and i realised that it wasn't some religious film but one of the most powerful movies ever made. The more i watched it the more i liked it and i believe that i have watched it more then fifty times over the past year. I recommend that if you have not watched it yet you need to get down to the nearest video store and hire it out.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),giaiphapseo,8,21 March 2019,I like this movie and the director. You need to watch it more than 3 times
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),patches89,9,7 September 2021,"For a long time I struggled to watch this film, wasnt a fan, thought it was overrated but decided to give it another go after such a long time and I fully appreciate it now. The writing is fantastic and the characters are portrayed wonderfully. It is a long film but it doesnt feel overly long as everything in it was essential. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were absolutely flawless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Joseph_Gillis,10,22 April 2000,"The gangster film was pretty much the property of Warner Bros during the 1930's. And rightfully so. With their star line-up of Bogart, Edward G., Muni, Raft, O'Brien and the magisterial Cagney , how could they fail?. Public Enemy, the original Scarface, the Roaring 20's, Little Caesar. Even today these films still have a great raw power no matter how certain elements may be dated. And with White Heat Warner proved they could still come up with a truly great gangster film in the late 40's ."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ChaseMc,10,12 November 2000,"I find it extremely disheartening that people would complain about the length of ""The Godfather.""  Unlike most movies of the three hour duration, I find that when I view ""Godfather,"" not once do I look at my watch or think about how long it is.  And that is simply because it is the closest thing to perfection on  film that we have yet to see.  Never once do I question it when I see this ranked as the #1 film on various lists.  Coppola, despite a shaky career of hits and misses, created a structural story so memorable and unmatched that it must have the three hour length to fully develop into a nuanced story, setting the stage for its successors.  And I challenge anyone to find a more memorable screen performance than Marlon Brando.  So for those of you who don't like three hour movies, you'd better stick to the 90 minute masterpieces like ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" You'll probably understand them better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ibrahimalhendawieu,10,29 October 2017,I love this movie. I discover something new every time I have seen it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thamerga,10,8 December 2021,"The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre and over the years I've watched over 500 movie of many different genres and so many different countries, culture... and still believe that The Godfather movie is the best film I've ever watched ! If u ask me what's so appealing about it i don't really know how to answer is it the music ? Is it Marlon Brando acting ? Is it Al Pacino performance ? I can't really say it's just a masterpiece ... i wish if i could give it 1000 star not just 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),unclesalty22,10,20 October 2006,"I think this movie is better than every other movie put together. Absolutely perfect. I won't go on why because I see everyone else already stated why this movie is amazing. Easily the best movie ever. If you don't like this movie you don't like movies, period. The music, acting, directing, dialog are all fantastic. The only other movie that can match this is PART II. With is the second best movie ever. This movie will live forever in the minds and hearts of every movie lover around the world. I can;t see how anyone can call this moving boring, actually this first time I watched it I thought it was just okay, but by the third time I was blown away. If you haven't seen this film go NOW and watch it, and then watch it again and again. It will the best movie experience of you life, I promise you that."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nicckkalbert,10,22 December 2018,"I love everything about this movie, the acting, the imagery, the intrigue, the score...the only thing I have a problem with though is the title. Like can you really sleep at night? Like honestly REM sleep, knowing that you single-handedly stole the title of The Godfather from the demon of the north himself, Krampus. Adjacently, The Godfather 2? *Bleh* more like Jack I'm the Box Rises. Come up with something original next time, for God's sake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fergusfahungerford,10,27 March 2021,Totally blown away. Absolute masterpiece one of the best films ever made!!!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),torrado-767-284731,9,17 August 2013,"We know from Gay Talese's book Honor Thy Father that being a professional mobster isn't all sunshine and roses. More often, it's the boredom of stuffy rooms and a bad diet of carry-out food, punctuated by brief, terrible bursts of violence. This is exactly the feel of ""The Godfather,"" which brushes aside the flashy glamour of the traditional gangster picture and gives us what's left: fierce tribal loyalties, deadly little neighborhood quarrels in Brooklyn, and a form of vengeance to match every affront.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow mein out of paper cartons."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yanetmenaa,9,1 February 2020,"I'm not one to watch old movies because the quality bothers me, but this is worth it. Great movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),WubsTheFadger,10,14 May 2018,Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rallierf1,10,30 January 2007,Great movie.. at first it seems as a slow development... but the whole movie is the development of things to come and how the characters are reshaped and become what they are and you are completely glued to the plot. It is not your typical movie that you can figure out everything from the beginning or almost from it. Here if you are really really smart and maybe know a bit about the plot may figure something out but in general the movie is leading you. There is nothing which is stupid in this movie! but you have to be concentrated not to miss any part because everything is so integral in realising what was what!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CNagieb,9,20 October 2014,"One of the best 10 movies of all times and it's really amazing work.. It is here that writers Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque fair considerably better. The Palmer family's back story is well thought-out and moving, effectively allowing us to understand."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),avagyan-grant-757-748130,10,29 August 2016,This is one of the best movies I have EVER!! seen. The depth of characters. The drama. The griping story. Everything is just perfect. Pacing of this movie is a bit slow at times but it's needed to build up to something bigger if you know what I mean. And the soundtrack? Beautiful music which fits perfectly for the movie. Nino Rota did a great job. Marlon Brando as godfather was the best casting for the role ever! He just showed how acting should be done. Again one the well made and perfectly crafted movies ever. If you haven't seen this. You are really missing out! Go ahead and watch it right now! You will not be disappointed.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vmoreno2007,10,28 December 2017,"Spoilers!!!!The movies are just as rich in dialogue and plot as the books themselves. It is a compelling saga about the rise of the mobster Corleone family. You have to watch it several times before you understand the depth and magnitude of the storytelling. Marlon Brando was hailed for his acting in this film, I thought Al Pacino who plays the conflicted son of the patriarch had far more facets and nuances. I watched Godfather 2 and then 1 back to back so forgive me if the reviews overlap it really is one continuing story. It starts with an Italian marriage of the daughter where Vito grants favors to the Sicilian communities and extracts favors in return, You cannot help but side with his character.He has a sordid seedy side with mobsters, organized crime and racketeering. And yet the audience empathizes with his strong love for his Italian family as well as his ties and loyalty to his even closer knit mobster family. We see the magnitude of the power of the Godfather when Tom Hagen, the adopted son of the Godfather, an Irish Lawyer goes to Hollywood to send a message from the Godfather. He wanted his friend Johnny to have a plum role in an upcoming movie. The director shows off his beautiful mansion and $600,000 show horses. The director quickly becomes enraged at the request seeing that Johnny had stolen a starlet he was involved with and sends Tom on his way (Duvall). The next morning comes one of the most memorable scenes where he wakes up to the graphic bleeding horse head. The scene is powerful. Marlon Brando does some of his best acting in this piece it is best role of his lifetime which ultimately defines his acting for his generation as well as future generations to come. Every gesture is well thought and planned. From the script comes lines that even now are still unforgettable and are still often quoted--""I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse"". The best acting is not when someone shows a full range of emotion it is at its best during quiet solitude, you can see Don Vito pondering and thinking his next step. he is pained when he hears Michael probably his most beloved son had killed the police and was sent away to Sicily, Michael's fate is sealed. He had always wanted him to be of legitimate power being the smartest of all the children. The quiet garden scene is magnificent as you see Marlon Brando conferring with Michael who is now getting entrenched in the family business and how the Godfather says he never wanted this for him. Deep down, Don Vito just wanted to make good for his family. Despite all the crime, he still loved his family and kept them close united in the family business. Vito was a bit of a Robin Hood, expelling bad people to help the good people which is why we emphasized with his character and rooted for him even with the evil entrapping. Even as he plotted revenge on the local Mafia boss in Sicily who gunned down his mother, father and brother we still cheer for him as he exacts his revenge. As his power declines, when Solozzo wanted to do narcotics and exact police coverage from the Godfather, even with promises of more wealth, Vito still had a code of ethics, that was to do no harm to children and not get involved with the sordidness of drugs. we can all relate to that. An attempt on his life is made and as we see the great Don fallen physically and literally from power and health, slowly the rise of the younger Corleones occur replacing the rapidly fading Don Vito Corleone. Another intense scene ensues when one of their hit men Luca Brazi is found dead, a package is delivered to their home with a bullet vest wrapping dead fish--an old Sicilian saying --he is sleeping with the fishes. A scene that has been multiplied and quoted a thousand times over in film and in media. The Godfather's usual body guard calls away sick that fateful day which does not go unnoticed. One day Clemenza, one of the Don's faithful accomplices since the start accompanies the body guard on a trip then tells him to stop while he takes a leak. The bodyguard is then shot. Clemenza nonchalantly tells the gunman ""leave the gun but take the cannolis"", another famous line. Alfredo, the middle son of Vito is incompetent and could not even pull the trigger on the gunmen who shot his father, he is outcast to managing casinos in Nevada being cared for by his younger brother Michael who he slowly resents. HIs is a portrayal of weakness in a family of dominant men. Sonny is the oldest brother who acts before he thinks steps in as the next Don. Micheal hears about his father's shooting as he and Kay (Diane Keaton) walk by a newsstand. He is hailed as a war hero and is the intelligent one who never got caught up in the family business. But with the shooting of his father he is inexorably pulled into the dark side. He visits his father and sees no staff or guards he moves his father to another room. Enzo, one who the Godfather has granted favors to comes to visit. Michael enlists his help to make like they have guns. He shows Enzo how to pretend his coat is loaded with a gun. When Solozzo's hitmen come by Michael makes a motion towards his coat as if he's about to pull out a gun and the mob car quickly scurries away. The cinematography is dramatic and magnificent. This scene was set at night. Michael hiding in the shadows and the shadowy figures of the hitmen are gripping telling the story of revenge, crime and evil. You see Enzo sjaking like aleaf knowing he could have nearly been gunned down. The police come by and the corrupt chief breaks Michael's jaw when he tells Michael to leave. Tom quickly comes by posing with private investigators, but the corrupt cop knows when to high tail it. This is the fateful night that Michael turns, you see a fine display of emotions on his face and he is compelled to do something to save his father which wins over his reticence in getting involved. You can practically see Michael's thoughts it is an all consuming role. Michael cannot deny his loyalty to his father despite his innocence. While Sonny and the main caporegimes are plotting, Michael pipes up he will take out the chief of the police and Solozzo. They are stunned It was unthinkable. They are astounded but impressed by Michael who is well known even among the 5 families of crime to be not involved. This marks his entry into depravity and darkness. They plan to use a respectable restaurant where the gun will be planted in advance in a bathroom, Clemenza reiterates 2 bullet to the head then drop the gun and walk. The plan goes without a hitch. Michael is banished to Sicily for a year where he falls in love with a beautiful but virtuous Italian girl. It is charming to see how women used to be courted before women's liberation and women are still virtuous. He courts her the old fashioned way slowly wins over the father and it is quite beautiful seeing the old world ways where she is chaperoned by 5 older women. You see the charming traditions of a Sicilian wedding set against a picturesque backdrop of old world villages and beautiful hills You feel like you are a part of the wedding party. He teaches her how to drive, but alas, one of his bodyguards plots to plant a bomb and his beautiful young wife gets caught in the crossfire. Michael goes home but does not seek Kay for another year. Kay is hurt but accepts him back and you wonder how a sweet innocent women can blend in with such a family ridden with crime. Connie, the only daughter of the Godfather, is wrapped up in her own drama. Her husband is a violent man.; She is often seen with bruises and black eyes. Sonny's temper is ultimately his downfall. He threatens Connie's husband if he should ever touch his sister again like that he would not see the living daylights. Connie's husband betrays the family and sets Sonny up by provoking a fight with Connie. Knowing Connie will be home he asks a mistress to call causing her to lose her temper followed by a glorious scene of dish smashing. It felt real as if you were in the room with them, what followed next was a very realistic scene of her husband taking his belt off and she runs to the bathroom with cries of terror, it was very uncomfortable to watch but you felt the raw emotion. Sonny hears about it and without an escort runs to Connie's defense and is assassinated in a brutal gun scene on the Long Island causeway, which is one of the most unforgettable scenes of the movie. Here you felt the backlash of crime and what befalls you when you get mixed up with it. Kay asks Michael if he would be the godfather to Connie's child. He consents but in the back of his mind is plotting the revenge of his father and his brother. The last scene is iconic and intense. You have the pure sacred baptism of Connie's sweet little baby with the congregation being asked to renounce sin, Satan contrasting with gory scenes of the 5 family heads gunned down graphically, one is having a massage being gunned down by a hitman through his glasses, another is trapped in a hotel of St. Regis and gunned down through he glass doors, another is gunned down in an elevator by Clemenza, another is gunned down in bed with his mistress all the while you see scene. The vendetta is final and complete. In the end, Michael exacts his cold revenge from Connie's husband who is led away in a car and garroted. In the last scene, he lies to Kay and she watches him being silently hailed while the caporegimes kiss his hand and the door slowly closes, it was an awesome scene. In sum, it's movie of deep family love, traditions and culture, betrayal, passion, greed, revenge, innocence turning into evil and that no matter how powerful you are there is always someone more powerful who will gun you down. Godfather is the best movie I have ever seen in my life, nothing compares."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),clouds88,9,20 December 2014,"There are some movies which cannot be reviewed. We can all have our opinions, but we cannot rate them. These are the movies which go beyond the ratings and awards. The Godfather (1 and 2) is one such movie(s). To give a rating to these two movies would be an insult to its creators and I am not making any attempt to do so. These are two legendary movies, each an epic, a magnum opus for all other 'Don' movies."

And its continual reign at the top of the IMDb.com top 250 proves this. There have been so many reviews written about this movie and its subsequent sequels, so much written about it - not only here on this website but in magazines, books, universities, the whole caboodle - that someone like me has to be careful that their review doesn't go over too much old ground and become boring.

Few have succeeded but the ones that followed the happening closely took advantage of it and rebuilded the age of honor. A whole book can be written for one of the greatest pictures of all time and we could not be even close to explaning how good actually it was! For those who haven't watched it yet it's a must! For those who watched it I'm sure they've watched at least a thousand times. If I must say a few words for the acting I might say that I am not among the big fans of Marlon Brando but his role in this movie is the role of his life! What can I say about Al Pacino? Genius! Only one man could have played the role of Michael Corleone and that is him! I even thing that Brian De Palma didn't think twice when he had to pick the actor for Scarface 10 years later. All the rest are on the same level and whenever we see them in other pictures we think about The Godfather. Lets just point them out - James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale and much much more!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),EdwardtheBlackPrince,9,22 March 2022,"Gangster films have been one the pillars of Hollywood. Since their debut in the 30s of the Golden Age. Classics such as The Public Enemy and White Heat spotlighted the criminal life. Viewed as a true grit crime drama that not only entertained audiences but made one dream of that lifestyle with all the pros and cons. Eventually, mobsters began to faze out in favor of other genres primarily Westerns. In 1972 Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Francis Puzo forever changed how gangsters were depicted with The Godfather. It took organized crime and brought it into a realistic depiction not ever seen before. Based on the Novel by Puzo, The Film follows the lives of the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The Godfather most feared, respected, and powerful Criminal in New York. We follow over the years as Vito gets older and begins to lose power, all while through reluctance his youngest Son Michael (Al Pacino) slowly comes to power as head of the Family. The reason why The Godfather has the status that it does is because of its tone it gave gangsters more of a romanticized sort of Glorifying the Mob. Here you have this family that has all this power and respect. Its cultural impact depicted them as real people as opposed to just cutting out stereotypes. Even though it is a gangster film it is more so about the family than one of the major themes. The way families act. The use of its beautiful soundtrack and the dialogue add more Authentic appeal to Italian culture. The film shook waves with its more realistic dedication Death and the Violence felt more real from being shot to being ridden with bullets. Gives a taste of what life in a family like this was like or could be like. The acting is top-notch from everybody in the from James Caan as Sonny, his attitude very traditional wise guy quicker to anger and aggression. Diane Keaton is sort of the naive love interest. Though the two who make the film the most are Brando & Pacino. Overwhelming development Brando's Godfather is iconic everybody has been inspired by this character. This character has been spoofed and parodied in so many things. Like Carmine the Roman Falcone from Batman. He comes off as a man of honor, while in the context of this film, you don't know anything about him just more so how he's built up. However, the way Brando speaks and how he carries himself you get the idea that this is a powerful man. He honors his family he understands the plights of those who come to him on the wedding day he's not a pushover, but he is fair in a way. The progress that Al Pacino handles well from the beginning he's more innocent out of the family business., but as the movie goes on and the events that occur can kind of see how to ends up where he does it doesn't feel like you question why he goes down this path. How his mannerism changes it's a different person by the end. It's classy, and thematic it's. Groundbreaking if not for The Godfather there wouldn't be gangster media like there is today."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mahirme,9,21 November 2023,"The Godfather is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece that stands as a testament to the art of filmmaking.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spkenson,10,27 January 2008,"Today a very well known movie and for me the best ever. The story is based on the novel -The Godfather- from which the movie obviously got its name and it follows the most part of the story in the novel. The cast is also excellent the stars who play each character fit their role in the movie perfectly. Some parts of the story may become confusing to some audience if they don't pay much attention to the movie, i found the movie more interesting when i watched it the 3rd time because I had missed some tiny details which make this movie so good. The story won't become boring, it keeps you watching the movie all the time because you really want to know what will happen next which is quite rare in many movies. The effects are also done well for the 70's period, they look very realistic. The movie really gives you a good description of that dark period in history in a non boring way.Those who enjoy watching drama will love this movie."

This movie has some of the best written dialogue ever put to screen. This movie is also unmatched in its acting, still being one of the greatest casts ever. On top of all of this there is a great story of someone becoming a family man even though that goes against what he previously thought moral. Micheal Corleone has one of the biggest character arcs of any character ever, he is a totally different man by the end of this movie. The Godfather is a timeless movie and inspired a generation of film."

I watched this film with my grandfather, and it was the basis for my senior thesis. i have studied Coppola' touch, and am studying to be a director myself. The Godfather is the reason that i myself am invested in the film industry. i want to make movies for the records. I want to make movies that for generations will be remembered.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),helswan,10,26 May 2014,"This film blurs the lines between a common business man and a mobster. From the opening scene with Bonasera, you could see so much emotion in it. The room is properly lit and the characters have a certain aura that surrounds them. You see the room is dark but the characters make the room bright. The opening scene alone is already worth the ticket. It has so much depth and emotion on the things that are happening in that world. This film shows you perfectly how respect and wit can get you through the wicked world. I recommend this to everyone who are knowledgeable and are discriminating mobsters then think too high on political figures. This film is a perfect 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahjaber25,9,29 April 2020,"Great! This movie represents the deep departed in characters, Al Pacino did amazing job, he made all of his father's enemies pay, but with their lives instead with money. This transmission in his personality was not expected, he rises all the way from the bottom to the top while the movie runs."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JPTaylor,10,21 May 2004,"Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a landmark of cinema.  The three-hour film is the result of an incredibly precise brand of filmmaking.  Despite the fact that the story spans a number of years and thousands of miles, there is a clear, very natural progression throughout the film (with the exception of a subplot or two).  The characters are complex and varied, each playing a specific role that contributes to the story.  The film does admirably well in keeping the story relatively coherent, despite its complexity."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),armycrazy,9,25 April 2012,"I absolutely loved this movie. It offers a unique view of the mafia and its workings from within the organization. It shows them as real people, not the heartless, emotionless criminals everyone makes them out to be. They aren't petty thugs like most criminals you see running around today. The Godfather is unique because it shows these criminals as having a sense of honor and dignity. Everything done is strictly business, nothing more. It has plenty of action and drama to keep me wanting more. Something about the way this movie is done, the way the actions are done out, the way the mafia is portrayed as operating, keeps me coming back to this movie, keeps me wanting to see more. I absolutely love this movie and will watch it again and again."

No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them.

Many people has argued that the Godfather is in reference to Brando and some would disagree and say it was Pacino.  See the movie and judge for yourself.  Two thumbs up!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Narrator_16,10,6 December 2018,"The film is pretty much near-perfect, what else is there to say. If you haven't seen it, watch it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Frosst,10,29 September 2016,"This is simply the greatest film ever made. It has everything from great cinematography to perfect acting. We all know of course that Marlon Brando brings his best performance here but so does every other actor. The greatness of this film cannot be undone and what makes it even better is the way it utilizes this. A story of backstabbing, honor, the mafia way of life and a lot of partying makes this film a true masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saeid-k7474,10,20 April 2019,"Good acting of the actors, awesome story, awesome musice, awesome directory and.....
Are the power points of this masterpiece"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sabbir-hossain-abir,10,4 April 2023,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, the movie is based on the novel by Mario Puzo and tells the story of the Corleone family, one of the most powerful Mafia families in New York City."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stanleedirector,10,6 May 2014,The Godfather is one film that has continued to inspire my perception of film making. The strongest essence of the film in my opinion would be the meticulous use of Chairescureo; a term coined by Leonardo Da Vinci which typifies the sentimental use of darkness in enhancing light as exemplified in most of Don Corleone's scenes. 
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nmsell-40085,10,5 July 2018,"I remember when I first saw parts of this movie, I was a curious child and looked up to my own dad so I wanted to see what he watched. I only remember the beginning scene, but then as I got older and I went to film school I finally went back to continue watching this film. This film really had my mind going and really remind me to why I wanted to become a filmmaker in the first place. The storytelling is the best part, just everything about this movie is just incredible in it's own way and I am glad I was finally able to watch this movie from beginning to end and it has easily become one of my favorite films."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),qbkqbzprvp,10,15 April 2022,I think it's difficult comment on the film with remorseful and self-righteous ideas now. I always don't think its useful to just watch it once or twice to understand The Godfather series. But I really appreciate Coppola's shooting methods.and Brando Pacino acting and line skills are amazing. Just like lines in the movie:People are not born great but the greater they live.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mahaelwazir,10,15 September 2022,"I recently watched The God Father for the second time, the first time was during my childhood and the last time was after working for more than a decade in the filmmaking industry. I can strongly say that I am impressed with its tone, storyline and actors performance. I was astonished when I knew that it's the first acting experience for Al Pacino on screen adding to this the quiet outstanding performance for Marlon Brando. You can easily fall in love with the characters although you know they are killers and drug dealers. The family aspect in the characters are so real and genuine."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),palumbo93,10,10 June 2012,Now as this is my favourite movie ever made it is going to be hard for me not to be bias towards this movie and I will try and be as objective as I possibly can.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kriscolourist,8,19 November 2022,"I'll avoid writing that this latest set of the Francis Ford Coppola-Mario Puzo movies is an offer cineastes can't refuse (oops, too late). Seriously, though, this stellar 4K offering will doubtless remain one of the best - if not the best - home market releases of the year. The films themselves need no introduction. The Godfather (1972) immediately emerged as a cultural milestone; The Godfather Part II (1974) is lauded in some corners (although not this one) as being superior to its predecessor; and The Godfather Part III (1990), refashioned here as Coppola's definitive The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, is worthwhile yet seriously flawed (go here for a full review). The first two films earned Best Picture Academy Awards, with the original also winning for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Marlon Brando; the icon delivers a cheeky (in more ways than one) performance as Don Vito Corleone, although the award clearly should have gone to the real star, Al Pacino (relegated to the Best Supporting Actor category, where he competed against co-stars James Caan and Robert Duvall). Part II earned a total of six statues, including Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro as the young Don Vito Corleone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jackblyth8,10,8 February 2021,"A 1972 thriller encapsulating the slow destruction of a valuable family. The crime film, based on Mario Puzo's best selling 1969 novel of the same name - saw Puzo also co-write the screenplay alongside Coppola. Despite many debates over casting, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino portrayed their roles with excellence, not to mention James Caan and the evergreen Diane Keaton. A big hit in its day, the movie was the highest grossing in 1972, between $246 and $287, worth the $80,000 paramount paid to have license to Puzo's book. Spanning from 1945 to 1955, the film endures suffering, passion, tension and love, exploring the ruthless and dark profession in the mafia. In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone listens to requests in his role as don of the Corleone crime family. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion, showing that the Corleone's mean business. Brando's character is presented as conservative, worshipped and extremely authoritative, his work is his priority and his peculiar yet sinister speech reinforces his power. Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozo backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garrotted to death during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. With Corleone's first-born Sonny in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca ""sleeps with the fishes"". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. Michael's jaw is broken by NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant, where after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men. Michael (Al Pacino) having just returned from the war, initially wants little or no involvement in the Corleone's business, yet is almost manipulated into performing such a consequential crime. His characterisation is relaxed and the individual is often happy to take a back seat, but, as he is embroiled further in the family business, he creates unprecedented distance between himself and Kay. Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare, and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and violently murdered by gangsters wielding submachine guns. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life. We as viewers slowly see the descending reputation of the Corleone family - with Michael forced to keep a low profile, many attempted murders on Vito and the brutal death of Sonny. Devastated by Sonny's death and realising that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a ""wartime consigliere""; Vito agrees Hagen should ""have no part in what will happen"" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family. We see a transition in Michael's overall attitude, far more assertive and much less reluctant. His loyalties are now firm with the Corleone family, contrasting to his commitments returning from his work as a marine. The protagonist shows no signs of grief following the death of his short-term lover Apollonia, seeing it instead as an excuse to leave Sicily and take full control back in New York. In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini; Clemenza garrottes Carlo to death. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches them pay reverence to Michael as the newly installed don as they close the door on her. In all its beauty, we are privileged to visualise such a spectacle. As one 'Godfather' falls, another rises. Once Michael was in the business, he couldn't bring himself to leave, Al Pacino convincingly creates the innocence of the character from the outside, contrasting to his cunning nature inside. The cinematography is well-ahead of its times, most notably in the wedding scene. In the peculiar cyclical structure, the film began at Connie and Carlo's wedding with Vito as the head don. Since then the family quite literally crumbled; Carlo's abuse towards Connie fuelled anger inside of Sonny, who was brutally murdered on his way to protect her. Fredo Corleone preferred life away from the family, Michael initially disregarded the occupation, but, he was tempted by the power and authority that accommodates. His role as 'head' in the family saw his relationship with Kay deteriorate, something that he wasn't aware he was doing. Grabbing a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Possessing an ultimate calmness and collectedness, Brando portrays Vito's commanding jurisdictions and intimidation's. Most impressively, the American actor perfects the distinctive, soft-spoken tone of voice, reinforcing the brilliance of 'The Godfather'."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tanbalarai,10,3 November 2019,"This story is so realistic.
If I analyze why this movie is a classic, the reason is that this is so realistic as a Mafia movie.
It caused by the situation that protagonist started as a university student. He was a normal student like us. We felt our self in his place.
And then gradually he is changing so we can follow his heart.
In that way, we felt that his behavior is kind of inevitable actions.
His is required to do it because he is in the position.
His killing people is kind of the mission as of port of the society. It make us feeding fearful.
This movie's story is so well written. Especially about the realistic situations. We were shocked by that.
But greatest movie couldn't be made by only good story.
I think movie is a symphony of music pictures and actors.
This is indeed one of the greatest symphonies.
Well... what a wonderful movie this is!"

If you die or fall of this planet without this movie then you will do a very injustice to your inner self, to your soul.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),crel74,10,10 December 2005,"From the very first seconds, this film displays a sense of majesty. The performances are spot on - especially Al Pacino & Marlon Brando. The wonderful prolonged wedding scene that opens the film sets a standard for all other film makers. The Godfather theme song is tremendous - the most haunting ever. The interplay between all actors is of the highest standard and the ""look"" of the film is convincing & classy. This film marks the highpoint of American cinema and although films like Good Fellas and Field of Dreams have come close, the general standard of US films since The Godfather has been in gradual decline. Truly a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),umlaziking,10,8 January 2020,"I finally understand why this film is said to be one of the greatest or the greatest film, it's writing is just top notch and really keeps u hooked the entire time. The godfather deserves to be in imdbs top ten. What I'm sad about is that we will never get a movie this well written ever again, cuz writers today don't want to think wen they write, they just rehash and remake. I really wish we could just switch the writers of this time and the amazing writers from back then with amazing originality, making films that made ppl think instead of spoon feeding them. A masterpiece, 10 out of 10, I will never forget this movie it's just that goof"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),deleyshaun,10,20 October 2021,"This is an absolute masterclass of film making. Directing, acting, score, story, iconic lines , all top notch. Also the underlying theme that not all is what it seems - the supposed least likely ( Michael) ends up being the strongest. How often is this true in real life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dble07jamesbond,10,3 September 2001,"Next to Vertigo, The Godfather is my favorite movie.  The feeling of family is well expressed in the film and although Coppola was criticized for ""glorifying the mafia family"", the film does not show that but shows a devotee to his father, and his undieing love for his family.  The music is great, the atmospheres are great, and the acting is superb.  Marlon Brando is at his best in his Oscar winning role, and Al Pacino delivers a superb performance as one of the most well known characters in movie history.  No other person would be able to deliver the character of Michael Corleone better then Al Pacino.  This is truly a magnificent picture and not much else can be said about it.  See for yourself the splendor of Coppola's Oscar winning family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),h-42927-48851,9,14 May 2020,"This film, which is regarded as a legend, has finally been seen, holding a sense of sanctity to see the whole movie. In addition to my feeling of being blind to the face of foreigners, it's not bad. There are not too many stories in the last three hours that make you want to fast forward. At first, I feel that the godfather is a bad man, but it's only a matter of interest. At least he has his own principle and likes his saying: ""a man who doesn't often stay with his family will never be a real man."" No matter what happens outside, at least he does a good job in this aspect of family and feels happy at home
What's more, I have also seen the sophistication of the world. Why can the godfather get the support of some politicians? Because they owe him more or less. In reality, it's the same thing. Sooner or later, what they owe others will be changed. I don't know whether I understand it or not. But the whole character of the godfather is complex and chaotic, and the actors are also soul level performances, Malone's saying ""never let anyone know what you are thinking"" should also be some of the top, undercover maxims."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RenoirSoda,10,14 May 2020,"Representatives of Italian churches and triads 'successful people in the capitalist countries such as the United States have escaped, stolen, established, avenged, whitewashed growth history, and mixed the generation and destruction of family, love, and friendship in different situations. . Family interests are above everything else, and everything that is not conducive to the growth and development of the family must be eliminated. The coexistence of interests is the foundation of harmony, and the divergence of interests is the beginning of hostility. The death of the old godfather, the birth of the new godfather. Is the beginning of an unstoppable ending."

Some people say it is so long and boring but i don't agree with them. I think this one is more non-boring than most 3 hours films. Also it has a so good cinematography that you can call this film an ""art"". Also the dialogues and acting is so good. To sum up, this film is a must-watch masterpiece about mafias and gangsters."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sassonlonner,10,24 April 2018,"Is The Godfather my favorite film ever made? No, but it definitely is one of the best movies out there. Not only does it follow an incredibly complex story, but it is filmed beautifly, and the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is brilliant. If you call yourself a film buff and haven't seen The Godfather, you definitely have some work to do.
 I saw The Godfather for the first time when I was probably around 14 or 15, and had some trouble fully grasping why people love it so much. But again, I was young and probably just thought to myself, oh, the movie's old so it's boring. Boring however is definitely not a word to describe this film. It is the complete opposite of boring, with more suspense than just about any other movie ever made. Coppola did not want a movie which was from start to finish mafia gangsters shooting at each other, but instead a movie that makes you bite your nails either hoping for a character to survive or the opposite... The characters (originally from Mario Puzo's book) are either characters you root for, or they are terrible people who don't deserve to live. One of the humanizing elements that is critical to numerous characters in the film is their love for their families. Marlon Brando's character of Vito Corleone is a terrible man, who has had dozens if not hundreds of people killed before, but he has a deep love and care for his family.
 To sum up what I think about this film without spoiling anything, even if you're not into the mafia genre, if you are a person who claims to like film, this movie is absolutely a must see."

Great acting, great mood, great everything.  This is basically a perfect picture.  Francis Ford Coppola brought together everything and made the film very realistic.

Not to mention, the entire cast was exceptional. I could watch this movie over and over again!"

Although some might be scared to see the length of the movie, but every minute is worth watching. you never feel bored; not for a second. On the other hand you enjoy every second of it. The Al pacino part doesnt really come out in this part. this one is more of a Marlon Brando show. You feel the drama, tragedy, thrill, romace, action, violence all at the same time. truly a masterpiece movie made from a masterpiece epic of a book. No movie fan should miss it."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kebobulesatu,10,7 May 2024,"The Godfather is a 1972 American epic crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The ensemble cast includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),packagingbeeau,10,9 November 2021,"There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Vartiainen,9,4 July 2017,"The Godfather took the world by a storm upon its release and set the golden standard for crime films to follow, especially those of the gangster subgenre. It also continues to define the careers of many of its actors, including Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. And no wonder, the film is truly wonderful in idea, style and execution. It's also interesting to learn that prior to this film, people didn't really know that much about mafia. Apparently the real mafia even contacted the film makers and politely asked for the actual word mafia not to appear in the film. And it doesn't. Furthermore it's only mentioned once in the sequel."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),newfiesailor,9,26 April 2006,"Great story of a mafia family. Although this story does not reflect real mafia workings (a fairy tale in comparison) it's great entertainment with a lot of class and a lot of style. The sets are spectacular, acting flawless and characters intriguing."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mercurionos,10,20 September 2019,"When you finally decide to watch this movie, since it came out in the 70s, and you were born about twenty years later, you sit down in front of your TV with some degree of expectation. Expectation the movie sees in your eyes, then laughs at you for some minutes. And then a man wakes up with blood all over his pajamas and a horse head in his bed. So you realise that something you were simply fearing is actually true. That is the complex life of the Corleone family."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fawrc,10,8 November 2017,"It is certainly one of the best films ever made in the movies, it really is a shame that it is difficult to produce movies these days. with such an engaging story.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),studiogetz,10,19 September 2004,well... what do you really want a movie to be? did you ever ask yourself that? If somebody gave you all the power to produce a movie... what would you do? a movie ... of course... but this is NOT a movie. reality is not something that you can create at your free will. the hardest part in art is to (at least) try to express reality. But you will only express it as YOU see it... I think this is one of those artistic accomplishments that came very very close to what everybody sees. that's art. And thanks to Al Pacino & Marlon Brando ! anybody who even questions these actors... should think twice before. I'm proud to be a contemporary with Al Pacino ! thank you

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheMexFilm,10,1 April 2024,"A discovery that in these times would shine much brighter, because in these times the theme of mafias and drug trafficking has been very profitable and especially because this kind of films unintentionally started a cliché fashion that continues to this day. A simple example is that it was one of the first films that touched on this theme explicitly and that brought out fresh information on various topics related to cosa nostra in Italy."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gesse_crash,10,29 April 2016,"One the greatness movies of cinema. Amazing, anything is better there. One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema. The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pr-revolution 1958 Cuba. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi- generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a ""godfather"" ."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mkdpg-07520,10,16 December 2018,What can I say?
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rywjjqhta,10,17 March 2022,"As one of the most classic movies in the movie history, godfather has each aspects for us to learn from. From the visual aspects, one classic scene is when Pauli is executed in the countryside. The photography composition shows how (the Statue of Liberty) is above the horizon and the execution is under but parallel to it. This contrast brings a dramatic irony to the scene. From the sound aspect, one scene is when Mike was in the meeting with Soulaso. The sound of railway turns louder and louder when he feel so nervous and finally covers the conversation. The restaurant is actually beside a railway, but the sound is also subjective and emotional at this point. From the character aspect, one classic point is the depiction of the old godfather. The directer uses half an hour to depict a head of family that values family, friendship, and carefullness while most other movies tried to reach a contract within the first fifteen minutes. In conclusion, this is absolutely a movie that worth frame-to-frame watching."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ceohoangluyen,10,29 July 2023,"Critics and audiences alike have praised ""The Godfather"" for its exceptional storytelling, brilliant performances, and powerful direction. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is especially celebrated and is considered one of the greatest performances in cinematic history. The film's dialogue, including famous quotes like ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,"" has become ingrained in popular culture."

When someone hears that a movie is perfect, the best of history, etc... he/her creates expectations so high that no movie can ever fulfil. This movie is the case. Every single detail is crafted to perfection. Mario Puzo gave it the tense and realistic plot. Coppola gave it the dignity. Brando gave it the genius. Nino Rota gave it the passion..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ctedward,10,31 July 2022,"The 1972 film, The Godfather, has often been referred to as one of the greatest movies of all time. This star-studded cast showcases the start of many of these actors' careers, these actors we have come think of as legends. This film featured Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duval, and Diane Keaton. Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, the head of a crime family. From the very start of the film, Vito holds very strong ideas of respect and family. James Caan and Robert Duval are the prominent sons in Vito's underworld activities. James Caan plays Sonny Corleone, the hot-headed eldest brother, who plans to take over the family. Duval plays Tom Hagen, the right-hand man of Vito and adopted son. Al Pacino plays the youngest son of Vito, Michael. Michael is the one son who vowed to not get involved in the business of underground crime. He was a scholar and a war hero, the favorite son of Vito. However, with conflict with another crime family, there was an attempt of the life of Vito. Therefore, Michael thought of a plan to get revenge. Since Michael was the lowest threat to Sollazzo and the Police chief. So, they arranged a meeting to discuss the terms of peace. However, this moment symbolized the turn of Michael Corleone. He shot the two men in cold blood and achieving the revenge that his family so desperately wanted. We see Michael go from the war hero and scholar to the preferred next boss of the family. However, Sonny was primed to be the next boss of the family. With Sollazzo dead, his father seeked revenge on the Corleone's. Sonny was known for being erratic and having a short temper. They used the domestic abuse of his sister to draw him away from his protection and assassinated him with no witnesses. Vito, pain stricken from losing his oldest son, wanted the killing to stop. Vito would retire and Michael would become the boss of the family. Since Vito was so respected for his wisdom and silence, Michael was viewed as a threat and a joke. Soldiers that had been loyal to Vito had begun to turn on Michael. However, before the natural death of Vito, he warned Michael of the dangers to come. The other families held back on trying to kill Michael out of respect for his father. Once Vito was gone, so was Michael. However, with the intellect of Michael, he ordered the hit of every enemy that he had at the same time. This scene is done beautifully. Michael is becoming the Godfather to his sister's child. As that is happening, his soldiers are killing the people that sought to seem him dead. This extreme game of chess came to an end. Michael had now earned the respect and fear of his peers. He now began to build his reputation of being an unmerciful but calculated Don. Even though the movie is almost three hours long, I did not want it to stop."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kelxfy,10,28 March 2021,"I love this movie, it is one of the best to ever watch. I would highly recommend. The title itself is attractive ""The Godfather"". Since it was released in 1972 it makes it one of the most notable movie in the history..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),amie_dawson,10,11 April 2020,I love this move. The scene with the horse head is one of the strongest movie moments ever. I love the directing and the acting.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DJDOMINOS,10,25 March 2002,"Probably the greatest film of all time. This is a tremendous landmark in future film making. The acting is of the highest quality and helps you to mould into the esencse of the story. A very carefully and sensibly ploted film which is gripping, touching and frightening from start to end, especially in the penultimate scene where the baby is being cristened and the Corleone family kills off some of the main crime heads in New York. A must see."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),msuliman-80194,10,21 November 2019,"A lesson in filmmaking, these is easily one of the greatest movie of all time, I whited a hole two years to get the right mode to watch what every body describing as a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tiniphone,9,7 June 2024,"Now, i can watching him on movie. It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bradm-2,10,6 June 2005,"Between the incredible story, superb acting and a musical score 2nd to none this is the one all others should be measured by. No one has done it better before or since. Coppola mastered, under incredible pressure, not only the interpretation of a best selling novel, but he was brave enough to fight for his casting choices. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan and Cazale were never better or even equal to their performances in ""the Godfather"". Pacino fans may say ""Scarface"" was more of a tour de force, but to see the subtle change in Michael Corleone from pacifist war hero to cold-hearted killer is acting at it's finest. I have recommended ""The Godfather"" to a number of 20-something friends trying to imagine what their reactions would be. To a person, all have sung it's praises, proving the everlasting quality of ""The Godfather""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xiaoxu-64514,10,2 January 2022,"This is the most interesting film I have seen so far. It contains a lot of life principles. I like it very much. Every month I will look at it again. Each time it can bring me a different experience. I really won't get tired of it at all. Too many details and scenes are handled very well, which makes people can't help praising,"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lewboskian,10,26 July 2005,"I can't say enough great things about ""The Godfather."" It is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. The plot is gripping, an amazing interpretation of the American Mafia, and the film's acting is superb. The characters make the film seem like we are watching a documentary moreso than a movie. You can see the transformation of Michael from the reluctant son, to the man who inherits an empire. Al Pacino's performance is outstanding. Marlon Brando is such a believable godfather that I think mafiosos throughout history would feel intimidated if they ever had to go to a ""meeting"" with Don Corleone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ronishbaxter,10,6 April 2018,"I, Ronish Baxter like this movie very much. It is most dramatic movie to its time and direction is marvelous. No words to be explain this movie. I can watch this movie many times I can."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erdiyunusfb,10,8 November 2016,"I have to admit that although I have not had any information about the subject for many years, I would think that it would be a heavy future, and that I would face the film and such a thing. I do not think that it is such an exaggerated script, the impressive aspect of Filmin is not it. It was all over it. It was a great story that Michael, like Michael, turned himself into a character who could not feel his family's way of life, and that he had become his father over time. Brando's character was a legend in itself. If you're still watching, do not waste any time.I did not see such a heavy character. I regret that I watched too late. The work of the family was very well done. The tones of the auditions were all legendary. It was the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),irrmoffice,10,13 February 2017,"See something new every time I see it.A right mixture of tragedy and comedy.Found a common love and appreciation everywhere screened. Characters and all of the different personalities caricatured in this movie lives among us.The cast is so popular and familiar which attached me to the cast very much as true to the life.Sounds, music, color and light in this film are just remarkable. The methodology followed in filming each frame is highly appreciated.Emotions conveyed in the film can be felt in depth by each one of the viewers clearly and at large.Who can rate this wonderful movie for which the a simple common rate card is not suffice."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cremon999,10,3 October 2022,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10. Once i can be a director i'll make this move another copy but the language will be different. I'll make it Arabic language for Arabian countries. The Godfather(1972) is really true The Godfather film it's great for gang start who want to be a gang start this move is perfect for them."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),officialbrookshenderson,9,31 March 2020,This film captures the realness of the times it was set in. The acting is fantastic and the scenery general. The characters in the production have to each tap into sides that is not natural to them and made the film what it was by taking on the characters to the point where it seems like they lived through them.

Why? well if for no other reason The Godfather should be considered a classic form being the first movie to have the entire audince routing for the bad guys. It made it ok to be a criminal so long as you had honor. On side note the transformation of Micheal from war hero and all around good guy to the Mob Don is great, the way he can go from being so normal to being the Don that strikes fear into the viewers is amazing."

I always like to review it for feeling these things. You can even smell the blood!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),redcrossaint,10,25 June 2022,"It is widely known that 'The Godfather' is one of the five or ten greatest movies ever conceived. About three months ago, it celebrated its 50th anniversary, and was beautifully restored by a group of immensely talented people. I saw the film at a special screening at the Paramount lot theater, and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had watching a movie. Not only was I illuminated and electrified by the masterpiece up there on the screen, but I was also admiring how great the movie both looked and felt. I had always known that the film had become grainy, and even the first time I saw it I could tell. The restoration makes it look just about flawless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),g_ciltepe,10,3 February 2004,"I'm too considering as this movie has to be praised. I watched it when I was only 8.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joebf-04456,10,4 January 2022,"One of the most perfect movies ever made. In amazes me when people think this is about organized crime,la cosa nostra,or the Mafia.it's not. I think it's one of the most accurate coming-of-age movie I've ever seen, not necessarily for the whole family, but in my own opinion a prerequisite for every American."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zianimustafa,10,18 January 2018,"First, it is the best in history....
Beats all the films produced before and with him and after him and on all the films that will be produced in the coming ages...!!!!
This stunning masterpiece does not need any criticism.
the Director: Francis Ford Coppola made the best movie of ll time
Marlon Brando or Don Vito Corleone He performed the best in history 
i have no single thing to say just it was my favorite film ever
10/10 waw!!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ljsingh,10,29 December 2023,There are simply no words to express how great this film truly is! How can one still watch this film made in 1972 today?
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),swaxman,10,14 May 1999,"This movie gives the audience a look at what family really means.  ""The Godfather"" has the cast, writing, score, directing, and cinematography that makes great movies.  The story of the Corleone family is one that endures. It is less about crime and more about the trials of any normal family.  It casts light on the hypocrisy of the establishment through showing society its own dark underbelly.  The thought that a mafia don is no different than a Senator or President (Kay and Michael's discussion after Michael returns from Sicily and tells Kay he is running the family business), shows how naive society can be and how quick it is to offer blame on people who believe in something as opposed to nothing.  All in all one of the Ten Best movies of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lanaplavsic,9,3 December 2022,"This movie was really good but the only problem i have is that it lasts too long in my opinion. With that aside, Coppola changed everything we know in film creating this masterpiece. Stratnig from the plot and the sound, incredible editing, lighting thought out well. Also ,the complete change of Michael's character because of the family which we see is the main priority in most of the gangster movies was outstanding . Marlon Brando who stayed so in character, and the lightning always above his head which shows no emption in his eyes, where he had to show it with his voice did a marvelous job. And Nino Rota who made music for Don Korleone as a light motive and all the other compositions made this movie 10x better. The editing ,with picture and sound, especially in baptism scene, was so incredilbe that it makes it one of the best moments of film history in my opinion. The ending also has a really powerfull message. There will never be movies like this again simoy because we entered the animated era with VFX being the best part of the film. It is no mistake to say Coppola did marvelous job with this movie and gained the respect all over the world. Genious."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oleschockenhoff,10,7 May 2019,"I was born in 2002 but even this movie is not out of my generation it is one of my favorite movies. The theme, the cast, the story... Everything is just perfect an overwhelming. Thanks Coppola for this masterpiece of movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mhts323,9,6 September 2017,"This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from every cast member is standalone, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family and carries the power a mafia head should possess. James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons, with polar ideology but equivalent love for the family. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time you hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get a Metascore of 100 and it is. It was one of the movies which defined the crime genre or to say the gangster genre."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bufstuf2k,10,15 January 2003,"This is an amazing movie. I would recommend it to anyone. It makes you feel like a part of the ""family"". After watching the movie, you feel like these are real people, no actors. It's hard to believe that Puzo invented these characters."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Shanuceo,10,3 November 2022,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."

Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name by Mario Puzo , The Godfather is one of the only two films based on a Pulitzer prize winning book which went on to win the prestigious Oscar , the other being "" To Kill A Mockingbird"" .
 When narcotics hits the streets of New York and tension between the five families (Strachi, Cuneo, Barzini, Tattaglia, Corleone) heat up , all of the families wind up supporting Virgil Solozzo to avoid a long destructive war. 
 The film has every odd in its favor as Brando pulls off the performance of a lifetime portraying Vito Corleone, Pacino introduces his innate and instinctive whit and, Coppola's meticulous direction which shapes up into a genre defining timeless classic of the west. While Brando and Coppola walk home with an Academy win each, Pacino wins hearts all over.
 Released in 1972 and often crowned as the film of the decade, the film however does not appeal to people of all ages. Despite being a timeless classic, the film may at some points come across as very strong and too violent.
 A deep untwisting plot supported by iconic performances and impeccable direction, the film narrates a story about crime, drama, redemption and an offer you can't refuse. All in all, ' The Godfather' comes out as a benchmark in classic film making and speaks for itself. Even after all the years that have gone by and all the years to come the film continues to elate and appease the viewers, who return the love for the same.
"" Watch all the movies you want but remember it is a sin to skip The Godfather """
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),evancyl,9,7 August 2013,"No wonder this is considered a classic. The screenplay was excellent, telling a compelling story and eliminating all the unnecessary scenes in the book. The acting was superb. Marlon Brando as the Don was just as powerful and distinguished as I expected him to be. Michael's transformation from college kid who wanted to steer clear of the family business to a godfather in the making was highly convincing. It's a pity that the version I watched lacked subtitles as I don't understand Italian, but I could still follow the plot. I often find that movies don't do justice to the books on which they are based, so it's great to have found one which does the book great credit."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aalmeendaredia,10,19 May 2020,Very well written screenplay and one of the best cinematography
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yuliaruslianti,10,12 February 2020,"Vito sendiri telah memiliki 4 orang anak, yaitu Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone (James Caan), Federico ""Fredo"" Corleone (John Cazale), Michele ""Michael"" Corleone (Al Pacino) dan Constanzia ""Connie"" (Talia Shire) Corleone serta 1 anak angkat, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mehmet_Kay,10,22 December 2022,"As far as i remember, the storyline was very impressing. In a ""making of"" video, i found out, that for Ford Coppola it was hard to get the movie done. The production was not easy and the producers didn't wanted Al Pacino in the first place. I remember watching the movie on and on in my teenage years. Everytime you could discover something new about the movie. For me, the most interesting thing is the detailed development of the characters. Coppola still managed to show this details in the plot, although the development of the whole family is so complex."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samukaresma,8,15 August 2021,"Now, I have to start by saying I just watched it for the first time ever, so I am definitely looking at it with fresh, modern eyes. And that being said, I just don't see it. Maybe it was this masterpiece in its time, but I don't actually think it holds that well in today's standards."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dtzrchbdy,10,29 July 2018,"Love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kovacevic-ozren,9,14 June 2018,"A perfect combination of a traditional Italian familiy mixed with mafian and underground crimes. 
One of the movies you watch and understand the plot, but conclusions and story are changing days after."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joaosimonscunha,10,22 May 2020,"This masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola explores the Corleone family much deeper than just their business activity. It is worth watching every single second to really understand the complexity of the mob. In addition to a great plot, the acting is just superb."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alangeorgejames,10,20 November 2020,Absolute cinematic masterpiece!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),inovamedika,10,23 June 2023,"""Godfather"" is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece. The film portrays the world of the mafia in a mesmerizing manner. The story of the Corleone family, full of intrigue and betrayal, becomes a profound and tension-filled narrative."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mr. Screwey,10,29 April 2000,"About a month ago , i found the trilogy of The Godfather on tape, it was at a cheap price so i bought it. It was one of the best purchases i have made this year. This is THE best trilogy of all time. Even if you dont like Marlon Brando, Al Pacino or James Caan's other movies, you should check out this one, it is great , i hope you will enjoy it has much has me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gaby-13,10,24 October 2000,"I never thought it was going to be that good, Al Pacino was just perfect, the way Coppola captures the italian family essence was just amazing, the music made me get into the movie, and although it was so long I did not feel it...one of the best movies I'd ever see"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bullitosaladino,10,28 November 2002,"This is the best movie of all time. It has everything a good movie should have. Nobody can not enjoy this movie if they are decently intelligent. It is THE BEST DRAMA/CRIME MOVIE of all time, for sure, and it is my favorite movie of all time. It is Marlon Brando at his best. When people think of Brando, they usually first think of the Godfather. If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT!! You are missing out on an excellent piece of film history. There will never be a drama film more powerful than the Godfather."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),krissoehawan,9,25 June 2013,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Pooooh,9,27 March 2020,I reviewed it two days ago and I just wanna to say it's a famous but sad story.I will watch it again
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zecchinimarkleo,10,18 April 2022,"I don't really know what to add to the reviews of this film to make my review worth reading. The Godfather is a so well done, masterfully crafted film that deserves to be the Top 1 film in IMDB. Well it's not that far since it's ranking n. 2 as of now. I am a film lover and I have watched some amazing movies, many good ones, but also too many that disappointed me. I can honestly say that The Godfather is far beyond being amazing. The Godfather stands out in many ways: acting, cinematography, directing, soundtrack, story and of course production design, which is flawless. I've watched it 3 times and I know that, soon enough, I will watch it again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BattlestarGalacticaFanClub2000,10,22 August 2021,Phenomenal acting by all cast members. It really illustrates some part of the world we live especially when it comes the Italian Mafia. Nothing more to say about it other than The God Father was the pinaccle of flawless films.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Wayner50,10,17 June 2006,"The original ""Godfather"" is the granddaddy (or maybe ""goddaddy"") of them all. Followed up by two good sequels, the 1972 first film was the best. If we could have understood Marlon's mumblings it might have been even better! Al Pacino is terrific as young Michael Corleone, youngest son of Don Vito, played by Brando, who, all kidding about his dialogue delivery aside, gives an astonishing portrayal of a crime kingpin, a loving family man, a shrewd businessman and a loyal friend but a murderous enemy. My favorite performance, though, is James Caan as the fiery, hot tempered big brother, Sonny, Who is riddled by Tommy guns at a toll plaza ambush by rival gangsters. John Cazale is Fredo, the middle brother, who's not nearly as sharp or ruthless as the rest of the family. Talia Shire does very well in a pivotal role as the Don's only daughter, Connie. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the family consigliere, Tom Hagen, the Don's adopted son and legal adviser. Diane Keaton is very good as Kay, who will enter the family as Michael's wife, and discover the less appealing aspects of her husband and his family business. Richard S. Castellano and Abe Vigoda are both exceptional as the godfather's lieutenants. The plot is well documented in other posts, so I won't recap it here. The thing to remember is that all the people depicted are either criminals or beneficiaries of criminal activities, while they often show virtues, they are corrupted by money and power. This is a complex and moving film, filled with great lines, unforgettable characters and action. A worthy choice for #1 in this list, or any other."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ghana-Songs,9,5 January 2021,I really enjoyed this movie. It was very dope. The Godfather trilogy has been there for ages and there are awesome and worth the time to spend and watch.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mfarhanmfb-480-658965,9,20 December 2013,"One of the best master piece by ""Francis Ford Coppola"", Desevrs the best Rating ever. It gives Marlon Brando the new name. Al Pacino as his best. Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando, whose iconic performance has overshadowed an even better turn by Al Pacino as his son Michael) is a man for whom family is all. ""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,"" he says, and he lives by that. He's devoted to his wife, dotes on his children and grandchildren, throws a lavish wedding for his daughter, and kills or threatens anyone who gets in his way or that of his family and friends. His sons are all in the family business, which includes union racketeering and gambling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),deepesh-355-609949,9,3 May 2012,"A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ajhdari,10,14 September 2019,This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),suryawanshi-pp,10,3 March 2014,"The character played by Marlon Brando (Don) is incomparable with any other actor in this movie. Also the outline of the movie is fantastic. The story keeps on going and you never feel bored or non interesting scenes. The dialogues are very powerful. ""I'ill make him an offer he can't refuse"". The roles of Tom Hagen, Sonny and of course Michael (Al Pachino) are epic and very heart touching. The sound & music gives us a feel like Italian environment in USA. At the start you may feel a slow moving film, but as the time elapses the best of the acting, directing and dialogues comes on the surface. At the last its a must watch movie at least twice in your lifetime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Fenwayswimmer,10,19 August 2012,"Now, let's take a look at what anyone who is serious about film says is the greatest of all time. They're right. Both Godfathers stand alone as the two of the best scripted, acted, and directed films of all time. In all, they come out to the two best films. If you read some of my other reviews, you'll find that I consider a saga one film. A saga is best watched simultaneously. The Godfathers are a perfect example of how a series can get it right. Except the third. The third was just plain bad. Did Coppola really need to do this? Throw in another addition to the greatest saga in history? Sure, Andy Garcia was pretty spot-on as Sonny's illegitimate child. But they might as well have had someone like Dustin Hoffman play Michael, because he would've looked and sounded more like him than Pacino did at the time. And Sofia sucked. Good director, bad actress. It was not needed, because the first two were flawless. The ways of how this crime family rose, fell, rose, fell, etc., was perfect. I distinctly remember saying in one of my film classes (in front of a bunch of total film snobs) that Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The other students stared at me with blank looks on their faces, as if I had told some horribly offensive jokes. Screw them. Why shouldn't he be considered? He deserves it, with The Godfather, Part II, Apocalypse Now, and The Conversation. Four classics. Did the other students not like it because he made a couple of flops (Jack, The Rainmaker)? All the best did (Kubrick-Eyes Wide Shut, Nolan-Insomnia), and they continue to be praised. I did enjoy The Outsiders, even if it doesn't come close to touching The Godfathers. Apart, they are masterpieces. Together, they are the definition of flawless filmmaking. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),knowpeacethemovie,10,23 June 2018,This is The Greatest Film of all time in its Genre.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abdullahatalan,9,2 December 2017,"Best of the trilogy ıs this. I believe that Nino Rota's influence on this movie can not be denied since the main theme is actually amazing. They say for the song Godfather actually named as speak softly love. The theme is amazing just as good as its name. Additionally, al capone is the emphasizing character and I believe it was one of the most prominent character in the movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Human0,9,6 April 2021,Super cinema movie this movie show you the life meaning and family and also crimes life.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),loganstol,10,14 May 2020,This is the greatest movie ever!!Every scene has so much detail in it which makes pretty much every scene memorable! From the opening of the movie to the baptism scene. Every scene has value to it. Francis Ford Coppola almost did not make a masterpiece at all. The production company refused to have Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in the movie and look how that turned out. Michael Corleone is the greatest character to rise to power.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),reanyd,10,15 September 2000,"Before seeing Godfather for the first time I had never seen a serious movie like that. I was only 13 and my tastes haden't quite matured yet. Since then, I've developed a great love for the movies. The Godfather has led me to such classics as Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and many more. But Godfather, in my eyes, is the best of them all."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),persianlax,10,8 November 2017,"I actually have never seen the classic movie and was really impressed and understand why it holds the status that it does in American Cinema. The locations and set were beautiful and spot on with the theme. I thought everybody looked like they belonged perfectly. The legendary scene with Don Corleone where he is in his office on the day of his daughter's wedding. The lighting and shadows in that is really impressive. Another one of my favorites that show how a movie can take you on a journey. Forget about what's going on for a couple of hours. When Michael was in the bathroom of the restaurant and the train was passing by and you see him searching for his pistol. I think this is a great example of great cinematography, acting and writing all coming together to create a larger than life scene. Being in a theatre it emphasized everything by a ton. You could hear the train as if you are sitting in that restaurant. Notice all the lighting and shadows I was really impressed!"

A wonderful acting team with a great director, writer and cinematographer who forces us to see this film to the end. This atmosphere is very special and wonderful and it gives us a mafia feeling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benyaminmsn,10,4 September 2021,"To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Svirin,10,19 January 2022,"I had a chance to watch the film The Godfather more than once, it is so well filmed that the thirst for watching it periodically appears again and again ... The young Al Pacino still plays there and this, by the way, is one of his impeccable roles, where he took part in filmography. And Marlon Brando, who had the role of the most important and influential person, the head of the family - the godfather. At that time in 1972, this was far from his first role, unfortunately this person has long been gone from us, but I am amazed by his charisma, his ability to play various roles. The film itself is taken as an example by many people, it was filmed almost half a century ago, but they still watch it, and its ratings do not drop to this day. In our time, you will not find such a well-thought-out movie, now they put emphasis on effects, scenery, and the plot is rarely thought out to the smallest detail. That's why old movies, classics of the USA of those times, are so appreciated even now. Particularly impressive is the musical composition of this film, which excites the mind and captivates the viewer with its beauty from beginning to end. I especially like the scenes where there is no dubbing and only by the music itself, melodic or aggressive, you can understand what will happen now. This is the real era of the mafia, the underworld, where there was a war between gangs and the heads of such families had authority. Even the police and city hall were powerless against them. Money and power did their job. The Godfather recalls the story of the greatest and darkest criminal of all time, Al Capone. The truth is no longer in his youth, where there was only money, influence and great ardor to destroy all his enemies, competitors, to make holes in them. After all, it's just business! I advise you to watch this classic of cinema art and I am sure that you will be attracted by it from the very first minutes. I wish you a pleasant viewing:"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ToninadaS,10,24 March 2014,"It's a great movie which shows very well the structure and working methods of the Italian-American mafia. The excellent interpretation of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and all the others makes this movie one you must see. The great screenplay based in the Mario Puzo's novel gives to this movie a very strong story. You can also see a very good representation of the Italian lifestyle in the USA and the original Sicilian mafia. Each character has his own presence and they interact as in the real life. For me it's probably the best movie of the history, followed by the second and third part of the Mario Puzo's story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ksharif-24974,8,3 March 2017,"it is a good movie.http://khanmp3.science.One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing 'The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mark-617,8,10 August 2000,"The godfather is considered a classic, i now know why it is one of the most poetic movies i have seen. From the beautiful wedding scenes at the beginning to the unforgettable ending it is a lesson in film making. The story although very slow, is very good. The film does go on for a bit (about 3 hours) it can be watched in two sittings if you want to. The only gripe i have about this film is that it could be considered as a two part mini drama on TV (although a very very good one). The acting is outstanding Marlon Brando makes one of the most memorable characters ever and a young Al Pachino is also very good."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tony-farah,10,10 September 2014,"When reviewing a classic masterpiece like the Godfather, it is hard to believe that there is still something left to say. Well, to me , movies are all about performances and how a viewer can relate to a character. I am fascinated with actors. Marlon Brando has showed us that in order to be believable one has to search deep down his soul even look for a crazy version of himself in order to deliver a believable character. Directors should give the freedom to the actor to deliver a character that has to come somewhere from within the actor himself. Any judge of talent in an audition will tell you that a performer has to lay down his emotions on the floor and be true to himself so that the audience can feel his truth and relate to it. Marlon Brando has just showed us what acting is all about. The Godfather is now , thanks to Marlon, a man who knows that by lifting a finger his will shall be executed and the ""scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day""...Marlon Brando doesn't need to convince us how powerful the Godfather is, we are already convinced , he won us in just a few lines. Now we believe he is trying to bring Bonasera back to the ""family"" under his power and to the business of trading ""services"". The magic of the Godfather is right here and there."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salehmessijoker,10,29 April 2023,"When the actor reaches artistic might.. This is what (Marlon Brando) did..the genius boy of the fifties whose shimmer decreased somewhat after the fifties, but he proved to us that the lion gets sick and does not die... Brando reached artistic perfection in his performance in this movie.. A very great and calm performance with a light tone of voice and facial expressions that reflect to us that the character is full of feelings, as happened in the scene ""Look how they mutilated my son"" when he said it in great sadness and great facial expressions and in a tone of voice suggesting sadness and anger together, all he did ( Marlon Brando) in this movie is just creativity."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jesusdanielhernandez,10,22 October 2013,"This is one of the greatest immigrant stories I ever seen. The nostalgia and melancholia this movie portrait is just so close to many people's heart. We can see our own experiences, in the lives of these characters. From the beginning of the movie one can identify an uncle, or a family member with one of the characters. The story line just takes you in great journey, from the naïve and idealist Michael to the cold and calculated killer he becomes when he takes charge of the family business. The loss, the gains, the falls, and victories of the Corleone's family, we can feel them as ours as well. We can see how the moral code changes from Don Vito Corleone's leadership, and Michael's way to handled business. Don Vito Corleone to my point of view who have not killed his daughter's husband, for him it was all about the family, and community. I think Michael's difference was that everything was giving to him, and he grew up in an environment of richness, where in Don Vito Corleone, he suffered poverty, and worked really hard to get that kind of power, and his number one motive was the well being of family and community. Michael not having this kind of life experiences took a decision that marked his life, and we as spectators could live and suffer with these characters. "

This is probably the greatest soap ever made. It is so easy to forget what a great actor Marlon Brando was. Fortunately we do not have to rely on Superman to be a testament to his skill. This film together with On the Waterfront & A Streetcar Named Desire are a more accurate tribute to his skill.  I believe there are few books or films which really stand up to being seen repeatedly, this together with the book is one of them."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),inspectionservices,10,20 June 2022,I like this movie in the best.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CeoBlaze,9,20 April 2022,The Godfather is one of my favorites. Action real life events you can't beat it. This movie is one of a kind.when I first seen it I thought it was going to be like every other movie dealing with gangs. But The Godfather taught me lessons I didn't know I could learn from just watching it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kennylstar,10,11 February 2021,"Looking through old movies, I stumbled on this movie and what a find! It's absolutely perfect. I wonder why people don't quote it all the time. It's always nice when you find these little hidden gems."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),novoadvapaysystems,10,9 September 2023,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. Released in 1972, this epic crime drama continues to captivate audiences with its compelling storytelling, impeccable performances, and iconic moments."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Emil1948,10,5 June 2019,"One of the greatest pieces every produced. Not only that, but the movie was made with scissors and tape, to put the scenes together. True look into the life a mob boss , with his family and the aftermath of his passing. After watching this movie, time after time, I still try to talk or act as Marlon Brando."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wornbrz,10,8 December 2021,"It's a must-watch movie. If you are a fan of cinema, you need to watch it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shadansecond,10,21 September 2021,"The acting, direction, camerawork, dialogue, sets even; everything in this film is iconic. The soundtrack is one of my favorites. I've always loved the simplicity we get to see at certain points in the film. The character developments are just flawless, not just Michael, every character feels changed till the end of the film. It's just the perfect film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),azharbeegun,10,1 May 2023,"True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be. Top notch movie with great cinematic visuals."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),matsvongegerfelt,10,6 June 2022,This is THE movie. The MJ of movies. GOATed.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jasonagie,10,27 August 2017,"This movie is the greatest film of all time, so gripping you can watch it over and over, it's long and you won't get bored, at anytime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),filmboy-16,10,6 July 1999,"This movie is excellent. Anyone wanting proof of its greatness, just watch the baptism sequence, filmmaking at its best..... I really liked Coppala's style of having narrative scenes for a while, then punctuating it with sudden and brief scenes of violence. Everything about this movie is great. If you have not seen go to your locall video shop and watch it!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spaiderivan,10,19 January 2022,This should be the best movie (along with the second part) of all time. An ensemble that has no weaknesses.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nguyenamk,10,12 June 2024,"The Godfather ""Don"" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WWII Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jyotindranathstcet,9,4 June 2021,"""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kevinvanderstap,8,12 April 2021,You can not have seen this movie its such a classic.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benedictmachiavelli,10,12 March 2023,"I have never watched a film as well produced as this and i find it outrageous that none of the supporting actors nominated for the Oscars in 1973 won the prize. Cabaret sure is a great film and Joel Grey a great actor. But Al Pacino deserved that Oscar. His performance was astonishing, the emotions, the words, the expressions, everything. Though it's not only him. Every single actor in this film has a stupidly great performance, that's why it's as high rated as it is. It's yet to be produced another film every not a single actor has something missing to their performance. Even though it's a classic, many young people choose not to watch it because it's 3 hours long. Silly, in my opinion. We shall create a new generation who'll find admiration in this film. I would give it an 11 star rating if possible."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),patrickbateman-84347,8,5 January 2021,"Godfather is about mafia families and how they handle their business. We follow the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) is the head of family and a very powerful man while his son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) he tries to stay away from their dirty business. Marlon Brando was excellent in this film every time he was on the screen I was captivated. His facial expressions and his silent dominance is what you expect from a ""Godfather"". Remember any man who must say ""I am the king"" is no true king. You heavily see how important family is for a mafia man(and italian also) and how everything revolves around it. While Al Pacino portrays beautifully the son who slowly tries to learn the ropes of the job. The movie has heavy dialogues and the most scenes are people talking then acting for brief moment then talking again I really liked that , its not fast-paced not slow-paced either is just the perfect combination. Music was really good , I feel like if the music was not on point we will be talking for an entirely different movie whatsoever. Definitely a must see."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),officegandhinagar,9,6 January 2022,This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time. An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mehdisalmanzade,10,26 July 2023,"""The Godfather"" is an iconic television series that delves into the intricate world of organized crime in America. With its gripping storyline, masterful direction, and stellar performances, it has rightfully earned its place as a timeless classic in the realm of television entertainment."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thesorrow3211,10,9 July 2015,"This is the second best movie i have ever seen in my life. People knew that back in the 70's and still today it is unmatched in quality and realism. The length of the movie was perfectly acceptable otherwise we would never get the whole story. Anyone (and i mean anyone) who gives this movie lower than 5 should be watching boo-dome and should be banned from any movie rating sites. Worth to watching. What can I say. Only Aliens was better movie for me. It is hard to find word to describe that movie. There no mistakes in Godfaher. Whole movie is brilliant. Long epic movie about crime, love, power and other stuff. If you don't watch this, do it as quickly as possible."

It contains fantastic drama, a little bit of action, a little romance and the story of a family that can never be forgotten!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),paisalut,10,4 May 2023,"Hey there! So, I finally got around to watching ""The Godfather"" and I just had to share my thoughts. Let me start by saying, WOW. This movie is a masterpiece!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),blankid232,8,11 June 2021,Maybe that's because we youth have different brains from people from that age. I enjoyed the movie and it's incredible but there is 30 or 40 minutes that feels like a filler but yeah can't complain about it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kelvinselimor,10,2 March 2020,"The Godfather. Cinema from which it is impossible to refuse. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo have created a truly iconic gangster movie! The Godfather is a story about how a person changes his views and becomes what he might have been destined to be. I would especially like to cancel the excellent cast and especially Marlon Brando, who played the boss of the criminal clan Corleone stern and at the same time smart, intelligent and able to think ahead."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),giovanni-cuevas,10,26 June 2013,"Honestly this is a masterpiece of it's time along with our time. The story was very solid, sent a lot of messages for interpretation, and it is truly a movie that you can watch over and over again. The classic entry to Don Corleone sends me shivers every time. The movie entices you so that you feel as if you've known these characters for a while. With that being said, it nearly broke my heart seeing Don Corleone get shot and you could feel the anger along with the rest. As Michael grew to his top dog position, you could feel the change within a second, you could immerse yourself in his world, his thoughts, and his actions (whether or not you agree with them). All in all a absolute masterpiece in which you are not allowed to die until you see this movie at least once."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jashandubai,9,16 May 2023,"A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adrian-berbecaru-928-236836,10,19 February 2014,"The Godfather is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen! The scenario is unbelievable! The movie has many famous lines like: ""I will make him an offer he can't refuse!"" The story of this movie is very beautiful. The story views the Mafia from the inside. I think the story of this movie is real. The acting is superb. Thestory by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act. Francis Ford Coppola directs this masterful, brilliantly acted: This movie has two of my favorite actors: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando. Everyone should watch this film at least one time, It is simply gorgeous! I love that movie! I've recommended that movie at all of you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adam_pittavino,10,21 October 2017,"""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"". Simply stated, but it's a line that echoes far beyond the screen, and deep into film legend. 'The Godfather' is often touted as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to understand why. Francis Ford Coppola, out of his depth for much of the production, has undoubtedly filmed more than just a movie, but a timeless portrayal into the heart and soul of a powerful mafia crime family. The Corleone family, headed by Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, has risen to the top of the mafia pecking order in New York by not only by associating the family with politicians, but by strong family values kept in check with an iron fist. Just like politic's, a lot happens behind closed doors in the the world of a crime family, but unlike politic's, the consequences are much more severe. Not only did 'The Godfather' revitalize Marlon Brando's slumbering career, it put another's on the map. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, the Don's youngest and seemingly innocent son who has shown little desire to follow in his fathers footsteps. Pacino, who's status as one of the great actors has grown profoundly since his starting role, was a mere theater actor from NewYork and relatively unknown in Hollywood circles. But as the story grows and we see the Corleone clan come under threat from rival mafia families, Michael demonstrates through sheer strategy and cunningness the gusto to become the Corleone family top dog. While crime is the focal point of the film, violence is never far behind as we see the kind of ruthfullness required to reign in the criminal underworld. It's the little things that make 'The Godfather' the film it is though. The pasta sauce lesson from a Corleone family henchman, the cat in the study during the daughters wedding, all give the audience foresight into Coppola's grand detail and vision. 'The Godfather' with a scale of rich fullness rarely seen in films as brutal, not only holds the mantle of greatest mob movie of all time, but is also hailed as a turning point in the history of American cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bablupandit-38794,8,13 May 2020,"Such a great and amazing movie, God Father a marvelloues movie with a great screenplay and also a great cast."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),PWNYCNY,10,1 October 2019,"In a class I attended in college the instructor, a learned professor of classical literature, provided what was, to me, a novel interpretation of the movie and story The Godfather. He presented the story as a fairy tale. Now, every fairy tale must have its prince charming. In the case of The Godfather the prince charming is Michael Corleone. Michael is a cold-blooded mass murderer, woman abuser and cop killer. He physically beats his second wife who is the mother of his two children, kills his brother, and kills his brother-in-law thus making his sister a widow. Even his first wife, who he loved (proof that he is not completely depraved), dies violently because of her close proximity to him. He is a harbinger of death. So how can such a reprehensible and ugly character be a prince charming? Answer: By cloaking Michael in the trappings of middle class costumes and values. Outwardly, Michael is quiet, soft-spoken, well-mannered, self-controlled, well-dressed, and well-educated. He is, outwardly, a loyal citizen, a decorated war veteran, married, a father, a brother, a property owner, a businessman, and an obedient son. He has all the trappings of respectability. That sets him apart from everyone else in the story who, with one exception, are presented as being no more than a bunch of stupid crass thugs, including his two brothers, Freddie who is dumb and Sonny, who in addition to being dumb is hot-tempered. Compared to them Michael is a paragon of virtue. That makes him seem likeable, someone worthy of empathy. The only exception to the array of unsavory figures that populate this story and interact with Michael is Michael's father, Vito Corleone, the first Godfather, whose real name is Andolini. Vito was born in a part of the world still heavily influenced by feudalistic values in which vendatta and revenge-killings were the norm. If Michael is the prince charming, then Vito is the king. Despite being a premeditated murderer himself, Vito is a ""good-guy"" gangster. He resists pressure from the other gangs to get into the drug trade. A gang war ensues. Vito is shot, almost killing him. That makes Vito seem a martyr who is willing to sacrifice his life in defense of his beliefs and family. He is a king with courage and scruples. But with the king incapacitated, the survival of the family is placed at risk. Oldest son Freddie, being dumb, and second oldest son Sonny, being dead, are in no position to defend the family, leaving only Michael to take up the cause. Michael, who reveres his father, tries to conduct himself like his father, who is Michael's role model, but the norms and values that shaped his father's character are woefully out of place in the modern urban setting and applied by Michael come off as phony and contrived. As a result Michael becomes a twisted and sordid facsimile of his father. Whereas Vito was loved, admired and respected, Michael is despised, loathed and feared. Yet, he does the job of protecting the family, who are the ""good guys"" in this story, and by doing so fulfills his role as the prince charming who rescues his family when everything seemed all but lost. Michael is as phony as his family's last name. His pretensions of middle class respectability are a sham. His propensity for violence is driven by a depravity so deeply rooted in his mind and spirit that it gives cause to question whether he is still capable of showing any compassion. Yet he is the modern-day prince charming who is on a mission to protect what is his, even if it no longer exists except in his mind."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jayhay7,10,3 January 2002,"It gets a 10 because it deserves a 10.  Not as perfect as Rear Window, but better than Lord of the Rings.  We'll see if Lord stands the test of time. If we were comparing books....I'd say Lord was better, but because we're comparing movies...Godfather reigns."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),notfoursaken,10,13 October 2000,"Based on the old style Sicilian mafia, Francis Ford Coppola directs Mario Puzo's novel ""The Godfather"" into the dramatic tale of Sicilian Godfather Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).  Coppola and Puzo convey the importance of loyalty to the family, the cost of betrayal, and ever-present power of organized crime rings."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adeckofcards,10,20 June 2020,"Considered by many as ""the best film in history"", 'The Godfather' has earned a prestige and respect over the years, something fully deserved.
To speak of 'The Godfather' is to speak of a perfect balance, a masterful balance between an epic Gangsters story, a powerful family drama and a man's personal conflict. All these themes are carried by Coppola in such a fluid way that nothing ends up feeling forced within the story. And although it is true, there are a large number of plots, characters and relationships, the aforementioned fluidity of the narrative, added to a technical perfection to tell the story, causes all these elements to have an impact on the narrative, which is pretty intuitive. Each factor is decisive and influences history, something that every filmmaker aspires to achieve, but that no one can say has achieved as Coppola.
It is difficult to define cinematographic perfection, but if this were a conflict that encompasses all its characters and that all the factors play in order to tell the story in the best possible way, then we can consider that 'The Godfather' is a perfect work."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fivestarz-68619,10,15 November 2023,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),longislandjoe,10,23 June 2006,"The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. The acting by the legendary Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone is the greatest male performance in movie history. The supporting cast of Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton started their legendary careers with this film, their first important work in a major epic film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kpd1,10,20 May 1999,"Glowing reviews are pretty much universal for The Godfather, and nothing I can say here could even significantly ad to the mountain of (well deserved)acclaim given to this masterpiece.  The acting is superb: Brando is breathes subtle grace into the title role, Pacino gives an epic performance, Caan would never be this good again, nor would Talia Shire, Cassavettes is unflinching, and the constant analysis of every angle running behind the eyes of Robert Duval absolutely makes the film.  Coppola, as always, is given to the grandiose, but here it fits like the proverbial glove, and he guides smoothly from ultimate tension (the ""gun-in-the-toilet"" scene leaves me dry-mouthed in fear even after the umpteenth viewing)to ultimate calm. The score is by now a classic, but like the entirety of this work, never satisfies merely on the memory of what it WAS but always fresh with what it still is.  Overwhelming every time."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ZaidKarimSlopek,10,5 March 2020,"Truly one of the greatest not only crime movies but movies of all time. From the dialog to the settings to the shots to the acting to the story. The unpredictability in this movie in uncanny. Micheal knows what he wants from the beginning and jumps when he has an opportunity to reach it. Micheals ambition starts to cloud his judgement because he's so young and never had all that power before, it starts to go to his head. Unlike his father who wanted peace asking for a truce with the other mob heads. Each character has a unique personality and the acting for each character is completely different than the next. This is truly one of the greatest stories of all time. You witness a man come back from war than do a deed for his father than go back to Italy only to come back than take over the family. The look of sadness on vitos face when he learns Michael did the deed makes me feel sad even thinking about it.I seriously wonder if their will ever be another movie like this agian."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OrenLoni,10,28 July 2017,"The Godfather in my opinion is one of the best and well produced movie I've seen. I've seen it many times and it always feel like it's the first time watching. It's an excellent film to watch by yourself or with friends (movie night). You're certainly in for a treat if it's going to be your first time watching The Godfather. It's long and I suggest turning your phone off. It's just shy of 3 hours, but it's so good that it will feel like 10 minutes."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),matthutsonmovie,10,19 June 2024,"The Godfather (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, opens with a pivotal scene that sets the tone for the film's exploration of power, respect, and family loyalty. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is approached by a man seeking vengeance. Initially, Don Vito refuses the request due to the man's disrespectful manner, but he eventually agrees after the man shows proper respect, with the stipulation that a future favor will be owed-a favor that later proves consequential."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pedrosoler-38639,10,25 October 2020,"Think about this for one moment, ¿what makes a movie a good one?, ¿the performances?, ¿the cinematography?, ¿the script?, ¿the production?, ¿the style?, ¿the concept? ¿or all of them together?. ""The Godfather"", besides having all of this concepts, it has pasion and beauty. Every single scene is beautifully shotted and composed, this movie it´s used as an example of what is cinema. Cinema, it´s beauty or uglyness, cinema makes you feel something. I cried and laughed with this one. Since I was a kid, my dad rolled me this masterpiece and showed me how to appreciate it , not just ""The Godfather"", but every single piece of cinema I´ve watched. This movie taught me how to appreciate a film, it means a lot for me.
Anyways, let´s leave my opinion for a moment and talk about why you should watch movie. First of all, the cast is amazing, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, John Cazale, James Caan, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and more. Al Pacino, makes a perfect perfomance and Marlon Brand performs his best role in his entire career.
The director, Francis Ford Coppola, knows everything about cinema, I learned so much watching his movies, he doesn´t try hard in putting his style on, he just puts on his style and makes it happen with his absolute genius mind. The script is full of famous and memorable lines, Mario Puzo mixes poetry with crime into a family melodrama, every character is more than well written. The movie grabs you and takes you into the screen, I watched it so many times that I found Vito as someone of the famil, imagine the level of writting.
""The Godfather"" is my favorite movie of all time, I hope if you haven´t watched it, please do.
Thank you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jeetkaushik,10,18 June 2022,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now."

I knew Sonny was going to die but never thought he was gonna die was so many bullets in his body! Loved every piece of it! But I rated it a 9 because the movie didn't actually connect properly in the beginning. But the scenes after the wedding were GODLIKE GODFATHER!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),arthur_tafero,9,5 January 2023,"Saying this film is almost as good as Godfather II is not a knock in any way. It is a great film. It is like comparing a BMW with a Mercedes. Both are great luxury cars, and both have several million diehard fans; just as this film and Godfather II have their admirers. I personally prefer Godfather II and a BMW. But back to the film. Brando is great, Pacino is great, Caan is intense, Keaton is good, Shire is good, and Duvall is perfect in his role. This was before napalm was invented, though. The story is riveting, and every scene is a masterpiece of filmmaking. I particularly enjoyed when Caan beat up his brother in law. I never had male in-law problems like that. However, I could have used Caan for one of mother in laws. A film for the ages."

The second time I watched it was about 8 years later. This time, I just felt so heavy when I finished watching it. ""No Country for Old Man"" It is kinda biased to feel sympathetic with the tragic experience of Don Corlenone, but his persistent responsibility on the family and his indestructable dignity, deserve every drops of my tears. Marlon Brando had given a legendary performance in this movie. The performance from the young Al Pacino was also unshadeable. A story about a Father and a son, and a story remind you of becoming a real man with dignity and responsibility."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tomfeltonjr-14488,9,23 April 2018,I think the godfather is one of the greatest movie of all time and that's a #fact
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),flicmaster,10,24 March 2004,"Wow. What an awesome movie. When I was a kid, I never really could understand how great this movie was. It slowly grew on me and I began to understand just how amazing of a film it is. The one thing that amazes me most about this movie is how much of a pain it was for Coppola to make. Listening to the commentary by Coppola on the DVD was great. It really showed the hell he was put through while making the movie. Some examples are: 1) He had to fight to get the actors he wanted (Vs. Paramount). The studio said no way to Brando. 2) He had the threat of a ""Studio"" director hanging over him at all times to take over at any time. 3) He had various crew members talking about him behind his back about how horrible he was. 4) The entire scene where Carlo is fighting with Connie was filmed because the studio felt that the movie didn't have enough action in it so there were going to bring in an action director to finish the film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mga220,9,25 March 2001,"The Godfather Part I deserves to be seen for what it is, not what its reputation is or what Part II added to it.  With that in mind, my review: The first 2 hours are rather aimless, shabbily edited to look like a discordant bunch of too-thoughtfully-crafted ""moments"" without a common center.  The actors' portrayals, while very strong throughout the cast, frequently overshadow what they are talking about.  I tend to think that the story is usually the most important and interesting part of films, but here it is put on the backburner by, dare I say, too rich character-development. Actually, is that what it was?  I come away from it without any true understanding of Michael's motivations or concept of morals, or why he chose to totally ignore them in the pursuit of power.  I often felt that Don Corleone himself, who is not in the film as much as one might expect, is also hidden behind his own famous mannerisms and the reputation that goes along with being the Godfather.  Having said that, the last hour, with Michael as the new head of the family, finally gains a focus and becomes interesting.  The cross-cutting of the christening and the murders was perfectly masterful and thrilling.  However, how the film morphed into Michael's story (and how he himself morphed into the cold blooded killer) is rather abrupt and unconvincing, though I am grateful for the change in tone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vajta99,10,17 November 2000,"I just think that this is the best movie ever made. Screenplay is exellent, acting is brilliant, and directing is very good and without any mistakes. The best part of the movie is (first part, of course) is beginning, and the part when Michael Corleone is on Sicilia, when he met his future wife... However, The Godfather should get much more Oscars then three of them, and that is the only thing I don't like, but..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),antonwaas,10,6 February 2018,"What can I say here that hasn´t allready been said about The Godfater Part I. Yes, Pacino and Brando in the grestest Roles. Yes, a unmatchable Story. Yes, it has fantastic Music and finaly Yes it should be called the Greatest ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AntBee,10,1 March 2020,"Hands down, The Godfather is the best picture ever made, in my opinion. The Godfather II is also a great film, and so is Citizen Kane. Hollywood, in its heyday, made some incredibly classic films, which makes it rather difficult to choose which ones are best. I have chosen The Godfather. Have watched it many times, and it never fails to keep me interested and entertained."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kientrucavi,9,9 April 2021,"""The Godfather"" is told entirely within a closed world. That's why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove."

Winning three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Marlon Brando, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. The film has since spawned two sequels, ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""The Godfather Part III,"" but they aren't as good as the first part."

Not forgetting Al Pacino, who played Brando's son, was just too good to watch..All in all, a GREAT CRIME MOVIE EVER!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),finnmurphy2001,10,21 November 2017,"The 1st instalment of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather is considered by many to be in the top 50 films of all time. It has everything you want in an all time classic, with exceptional acting from the likes of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall. Mario Puzo's classic novel adaption delivers one of the few adaptations of a book that's better than the book itself. With perfect soundtrack, perfect dialogue and perfect acting, Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the best films you will ever see in cinema history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ammar-qisho,10,27 May 2014,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, musicin the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adriansolla,9,26 May 2023,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),horloges-68702,10,8 September 2021,Just a legendary movie with legendary actors.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),molocuabi,10,23 July 2022,"The Godfather is a technically instructive film with its dark and realistic atmosphere. The cinematographer of the movie, Gordon Willis, used shadows and contrast in such a way that you say this is the movie while watching it. While watching the dark and beautiful atmosphere, you also watch the plot. Some people may be bored in the first scenes while watching the movie, but I was not bored because the mafia theme was a theme that I loved before. The film chronicles the conflict between the Carlone family and Comma Solozzo over her drug business. Don Carleone politely declines the offer, calling it a ""dope"" dirty job, but Solozzo, who is not very happy about it, arranges an assassination on Carleone himself, causing things to heat up. This is the crux of the movie. We are watching the characteristic change of Michael, who normally has little to do with family affairs. Michel first kills Solozzo to avenge his father's death, and then takes over the family business. It's as if that innocent child who watches family affairs from afar is gone, replaced by a calm but cold killer. Michael is actually the opposite of his brother Sonny. While Sonny is an irrational person who cannot control his anger, Micheal is logical and just as calm. Although ""The Godfather"" is a crime movie, it is actually a movie based on the father and son relationship. The best example for this is the scene where Don Vito and Michael are alone. In this scene, Carleone says that she has always worked for her family all her life, and that she will not be ashamed to work, but that she has never thought of Michael as the head of the family. It was a pretty good movie for me, but I can understand that it might not appeal to everyone. In this movie, your main focus is not on the life of the mafia, but on the fact that you cannot trust anyone but your family and you have no one but them. Otherwise, why would anyone turn their family into a criminal organization? We see in the movie that almost everyone betrayed the father except his sons. (Virgül Solozzo, Tattaglia family, Carlo, Tessio) When I said you can't trust anyone but your family, I meant this. Finally, I have a cut-off message that I don't like the Godfather and hate him all his life: Watch The Godfather not as a mafia movie, but as a father and son movie because only then can you love this movie. Enjoy or hate the mafia theme."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),itechhacks,9,1 March 2019,"The Godfather (1972) has a lot of terrific mood, one great performance by Pacino, an excellent character segue by Brando, and a strong supporting cast."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Brgorm,10,17 August 2003,"This is Cinema history.  The acting is beautiful.  The story is excellent. The writing is great.  Every man can relate to this movie because they see qualities in these men; Vito(we see the man we want to be, wise and caring to his own), Sonny(the strong man, fierce and respected for such), Fredo(the beloved son, but jealous), Tom (smart, serious, but a bit of an outsider), and of course Micheal (the sucessor to the family name).  If you like this movie, read the book.  Its even better."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nouhnouh-49274,10,4 September 2022,"The Godfather is the most famous and influential film in cinematic history. It follows a family as it is torn apart by power, greed, and love. From an author's point of view, it can be seen as a long-form ""mini-series"" (the three films tell three distinct stories that are bridged together by the main character). Not only do we see great acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino but also a great score by Nino Rota. The film has been adapted into two separate book-length studies, one from Director Coppola that focuses more on the historical context of the times and characters, focusing more on its political aspects, and another from Professor Wolf who argues that it is not just about the action on screen but also how every aspect of the film contributes to creating such an intense feeling as if you were there yourself with all its implications about family, loyalty, revenge and much more for which we will give our own personal commentary below."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MrChaveX,10,13 January 2022,Ah! 'The Godfather' one of the most influential & one of the greatest movie of all time.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TonyTonyTony777,10,18 October 2017,"The general synopsis of this film without making a huge SPOILER is that there are a bunch of gangsters who are trying to take over NYC. They have a lot of fights between themselves and they end up in lots of tension. The tension is so real that you'll have to brace yourself and have REGULAR intermissions to take an emotional break from the violence. The ONLY spoiler I will reveal is that, let me tell you, you're in for a wild ride. If you are into gore, this is a wonderful, wonderful feature length film and I would highly recommend it. Especially if you are into the classic varieties of films like myself, the ones from the era of transition into color televisions that allow for a much more real and vivid experience!"

At that time it was my second time watching this film, and it just gets better the more you watch it. I literally had goosebumps all over my body when the movie started. I can't just sit for long periods of times and watch something without doing something else, but with the godfather, i always sit still and watch.....great!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GemaDiazL,8,8 November 2021,3 hours and still captivating. The atmosphere is so very well designed. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AndrewRozarioOfficial,10,21 September 2017,"What a Wonderful Film ..... Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),edgar-71720,10,10 June 2022,"I am writing this review while listing to The Godfather amazing score and it's just a great thing to listen too whenever and wherever. One of the things that gets me about this movie is the show of emotion in every character the performance of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is just something I just can't seem to ever forget they just had so much chemistry I honestly couldn't tell you who was better. A performance of a lifetime, or a performance that builds up to a better one that's the way I see it, Al Pacino In ""The Godfather 2"" is a lot better because of that build of from the first movie. But the way he coexisted with Vito/Marlon in the first film was just something to cherish I missed Marlon in the second film just goes to show how good they did with the characters. I love The Godfather and I wish I could've been alive when these films came out I call it the greatest film of all time maybe it's not my favorite but I can't deny the greatness this movie has brought to filmmaking and quite frankly to me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),veenusav,9,28 June 2017,"Shows powerful men's life. Its not just a movie for quickies. careful watching gives you glimpses of handling creatures of emotion and fear. its not exaggerated. But it is generally applicable in civilized society when leaders have emerged. Another interesting thing is usage of sound. A lot of sound and scenes are composed without dialogues. Light, silhouette, symbols of shadows are heavily used to 'frame' godfather. even you can hear a lot of family sounds without meant for any literal communication to the audience. baby cry, Italian conversations.. Bit lengthy and dialogue oriented. Only watch when you have peaceful time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ashokbm-05153,8,18 May 2024,"The Godfather is more than a film; it is a cinematic experience that encapsulates the essence of storytelling. Through its compelling narrative, rich character development, and exquisite technical execution, it transcends the boundaries of the gangster genre to offer a profound exploration of power, loyalty, and the human condition. The film's influence on cinema and culture is undeniable, marking it as a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences. Whether viewed as a gripping crime saga or a poignant family drama, The Godfather stands as a testament to the transformative power of film and the enduring legacy of masterful storytelling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Joao_Lisabona,10,20 April 2011,"Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. the people that dislike the film is just to blow their own mind, everybody recognizes the complex and beauty of the movie. It has a lot of goofs, although, but that doesn't make the film look silly. the mistakes are stupid, like a wine that doesn't exist on that time and etc. 10/10 is my grade to this movie that will be in our minds forever, because the good wine always taste good"

Francis Ford Coppola has gifted us with what is quite frankly, the greatest gangster film of all time. Goodfellas, The Departed, Reservoir Dogs and other great films of this genre cannot even touch the pure brilliance of this film. There is such an inexplicable gulf between The Godfather and every mob movie ever made. It does not allow you to take your eyes off the screen for even one second. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CoolHand-4,10,2 March 1999,"I have seen The Godfather many times over the past twenty years.  It started with my brother watching the movie and I watched it when I was seven.  The only parts I remembered at the time were the famous scenes (the horse's head, Sonny being setup at the toll booth) which goes to show you that if a movie can put a searing memory in a seven year old critic, imagine what it can do to the same critic twenty years later!"

This movie of which I have seen over 100 times since it's release in '72 has displayed the best of a well put together story about family. This family just happens to be into organized crime. If you have never seen the movie, rent it and relax and let yourself be taken away by the gripping story which is nonstop from beginning to end (of course Godfather II picks up right where this one stops). a 10 in my book now and forever."

Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.-srijanarora-152-448595."

I am not sure if I agree with the latter point, but I can proudly say is that the Godfather is just a Grand masterpiece which not only a fan of the crime genre but anyone who likes movies in general can enjoy. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),q-02121-71714,9,16 April 2020,"If there is one link in ""godfather"" that is related to fate, it is love. In such a man-dominated film, full of killing and yin. Mou, brotherly feelings, family feelings, love this thing seems to be just an optional embellishment. But when you go deep into the godfather's story, you will find that this seemingly insignificant wind and snow is sometimes a decisive link."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nevinhooper,10,19 November 2016,"The Godfather is altogether fantastic film. It is, in my personal opinion, flawless in every way. People who have not seen this film, I am warning you, because this review will contain spoilers. First off, let's talk about the acting. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are fantastic. And other actors who are first starting out in this movie, such as Robert Duvall (To Kill a Mockingbird) and James Caan (Elf) are also fantastic. Robert Duvall gives a phenomenal performance as Tom Hagen. He gave a good depth to the film by him trying to convince Michael and The Godfather about all the things that they are doing are bad. And James Caan gives a great performance as Sonny, who likes to get himself in trouble. Then, Marlon Brando plays in his Oscar winning role as Don Vito Corleone or The Godfather. He was amazing as the Don. The way he acted with his voice, and his hand movements, and you could just feel his reign of power over everyone else, but you can sense that his control his failing when the other five families try to kill him in the process. Now, let's talk about Al Pacino as Michael Corleone. I still do not understand why Al Pacino has not won an Oscar for his role as Michael. Especially for his role in The Godfather Part II. Al Pacino blew me away with his performance. What I like the most about his character was it showed his character arc perfectly. It shows how he realizes that the only way that he can protect his father is become part of the family business, and Pacino portrays that aspect of his character so well. For the way the film was done, it was done great. I liked all the hazes of grey and brown everywhere, it gave it an older feel to it, which made it very good. And the score composed by Nino Rota is absolutely great. It fit the feel of the movie great, I hum it all the time, so I give the movie big credit for that. But, probably the biggest thing in this movie that makes it shine, and I would give it the most credit for, is how this film perfectly balances the struggling life of the Corleone family, and the ugly violence of their life in the mafia. It balances it great, I am in awe in how they were able to balance it, because most movies today when they try to do that, they usually tip more towards one subject over the other. But The Godfather keeps those two story lines balanced throughout the entire three hour run time of the movie. And another thing that I have to say, or else I am absolutely insane not to mention this, are the amount of famous quotes in this movie! This movie is filled with lines that you will be saying constantly, like the famous line ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!"" by Vito Corleone, or ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" that other movies copy off of all the time! So, this really is probably the best movie I have ever seen, I have no flaws with this movie, which is why I shall give this movie a 10/10, and I highly suggest you check this movie out, it is an amazing experience!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JW-27,10,30 June 1999,"Possibly my favorite movie, this is an unsurpassed gangster film and well deserving of the universal praise it received.  It scores a 10 in my book, not surprisingly, but I will include what I consider to be some minor flaws. First and foremost, the kindheartedness of Brando's Vito Corleone character is extremely misleading.  I don't believe that any mob boss of that era, or even today, possesses anything but heartless greed for money and power. The viewer is left thinking that Vito is warm and gentle and had no choice but to enter the life of crime to support his family--bulls**t! The sequel (another gem) tries to explain this, but I still don't buy it.  Also, I don't think James Caan was cast well as the hot-headed Sonny.  He looks about as Italian as James Cagney.  His acting is superb, but I think someone like Robert DeNiro (who also auditioned for the role!) would have delivered a far more accurate portrayal.  On that note, it also struck me that Richard Castellano, who plays Clemenza, could have just as convincingly played the Don as Marlon Brando and, perhaps, saved the producers millions. Brando is, of course, phenomenal, but I think it's important to point out that the less recognized co-stars are comparably as talented.  Aside from this, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece not to be missed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),teomike-96976,10,7 March 2022,"There's nothing wrong with this movie, the cast is impecable, excellent performances, and a great story. The baptism scene is simply the best crime scene."

As a 38-year-old movie lover, I can confidently say that ""The Godfather"" remains a timeless masterpiece that continues to inspire and resonate with each viewing. If you haven't experienced this cinematic gem yet, it's high time you did. It's not just a film; it's an unforgettable journey into the heart of darkness and the human soul."

In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.
In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production in the film, there is the wonderful music of the composer Nina Rota. An excellent melody, fallen in love with everyone and has long become a classic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maxkarges,10,21 April 2017,"The Godfather is by far one the best films I have I ever seen. It is my favorite movie ever because of various reasons. The cinematography is exceptional. The dark atmosphere provides the viewer with a visual representation of the shadiness of the Corleone family. The directing and editing are beautiful, with scenes like the baptism killings and Michael's killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey showcasing this. The acting performances are fantastic, some of the best I have ever seen. Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone left a mark on me after seeing it. Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Vigoda, and Castellano all portray their characters perfectly. There is not much else that can be said about how fantastic this movie is. It might be the greatest American film in history. If you have not seen The Godfather, watch it now. You are missing out."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mbatmanl,10,17 January 2006,"I have a sentimental love for the first Godfather. Though part 2 might itself be a better film, i love the Corleone family because of the first one. Every time i see it, i remember why these people feel like family to me: sonny is like an obnoxious older brother sometimes, hot headed, but genuinely loving and caring. Tom is the level headed man, who takes into consideration the wisest way to handle things and benefit the family. Fredo is the one that everyone loves, just because he can't take care of himself. and Michael, he's everyman isn't he? He has dreams and goals and wants to live his life independent of the influence of his family. but circumstance formulates, and deepens his character. He soon chooses a path that he swore he never would, but he is almost forced to do it. Granted, no one is pointing a gun to his head- but his heart compels him."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ActJef1077,10,25 June 2003,"What else can be said about this cinematic masterpiece that has not been said a million times?  What exactly is it about this movie that ranks it the #1 movie of all-time on many lists, including imdb.com's list?  It isn't just the plot.  While masterful, I have seen better plots before.  Not many, of course, and not better by much, but there still are a couple.  It's not just the acting.  Again, I am hard pressed to think of better performances, but there are a few out there.  I will say that Brando's acting, Pacino's, Caan's, Duvall's, Keaton's, and so many others all mixed together were awesome.  But it's not only the way each one acts, but also the way each one acts off the others.  But still, the acting alone could not make this movie #1.  The cinematography, the lighting, the sound, the musical score, all these were terrific, but none of them made this movie.  So then, what DOES make this movie what it is?  I would say that it is taking all of these elements together and breathing life into them.  Rather than simply being a voyeur, watching all the action from the outside, the viewer is thrust into the middle of it.  He becomes surrounded by the action and to a certain extent becomes part of the Corleone family.  And as the movie races towards its climax, the viewer is pulled emotionally at every turn, forcing hatred towards good people, love towards evil people, respect for those who do not deserve it, and ultimately a great deal of sympathy for a man who rules with an iron fist and seems to be too concerned with his own well-being to care about the feelings of anyone else.  And yet, at the same time, we see that he does care, and he does feel, and he does love.  There is a tremendous feeling of family in this movie, a great sense of belonging.  And I believe that is the secret to this movie.  The viewer is not left on the outside, but brought inside warmly to share the innermost thoughts and feelings of men he might normally avoid and fear.  And the viewer learns a profound secret by watching this movie: There is no greater desire than the desire to belong, to be a part of something, no matter what that something may be; and this desire will be ultimately fulfilled no matter how much it is ignored or resisted.  Underneath it all, we are all the same."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xoxascott,9,13 November 2019,"Francis Ford Coppola must be a real perfectionist. The Godfather is an extremely artisinal film that can be compared to few others. The acting is unbelievable and the story is super intriguing. It takes the mafia world in a tone of 100 percent seriousness, unlike many other mob movies. The movie is also filled with surprises and loaded with powerful messages. Love it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmadsjohar,8,16 December 2023,"Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece, The Godfather, isn't just a gangster film; it's an epic saga exploring the Corleone family, their rise and fall from grace within the American mafia. Marlon Brando delivers an iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone, the aging patriarch grappling with succession and a changing world."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Marwan-Bob,10,8 August 2022,"I had the pleasure of Rewatching ""The Godfather"" with my friends for the first time on the Big screen, a movie theatre here in morocco offered us this masterpiece in 4K and we couldn't refuse, and man oh man what a Magnificent experience that was."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),faithellisontfe,9,4 December 2020,Its amazing how movies from the 70's are so different from the movies in 2020.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),896917,10,7 March 2005,"The Godfather is the pinnacle of cinematic art. In no other film have I seen an equivalence in any general aspect of the film. This is special considering how extremely picky I am in terms of movies, but if I would have the opportunity to change this film, I would not. I consider The Godfather to be a single film, not three separate ones. the reason I have so much respect for this particular film is because it encompasses all the values I find most important in life; trust, honor, family and culture. Those are the four that I value completely. This film represents such emotion that I cannot begin to describe how I feel about it now. Plus, most of my favorite actors are in this film; Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, etc..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),acorral-1,9,16 February 2005,"One of the best thing about this film is the terrific performance of Brando asDon Vito Corleone. He created a character capable for transmitting themost ambiguous emotions. For one side, we have the loving father (and godfather of course), husband, grand father, friend. In the other hand he is one of the coldest blooded characters in movie history. ""It's not personal, it's strictly business"" is the perfect phrase to define the way of the ""Familia"" taking care of business related activities. There are several sequences that have become classic scenes: at the beginning of the movie we see a merciful Vito sitting in his ""throne"" deciding the destiny of dishonored fathers, Hollywood actors, rude bodyguards. ""Remember that some day I will ask another favor in return"". Don Vito is respected as a priest, his hand is kissed and he takes care of the situations one way of another. Religion is, ironically, one of the main characters of the history. Four major scenes are related with catholic rites: Two weddings, a funeral and a baptize. Italian costumes are essential as well. The family concept, the traditions; big dinners with pasta, meat balls and red wine. Concepts as honor, loyalty, vengeance are reminded consistently along the three hours. In another classic scene we visualize the ""familia"" way to solve some pending issues: Johnny, the favorite Vito's godsons is one of the hottest Hollywood stars hoping to obtain the leading role in a movie. The producer does not want him on the film for personal reasons, but at the end he accepts once he discovers his favorite horse head the next morning in his bed. Robert Duvall is the adviser, Vito's right hand and in my opinion the second best performance. He is responsible of dealing with the other families. He hates violence but justify every decision to use it. He is the conscience and a critical member, no matter if he is not Sicilian. Other sequence (I think the best) is where the big families have a meeting to solve their differences. Don Vito did not want to be involved in the drug business, he wanted to remain with the usual ones: gambling, liquor and unions. His relation ships with influent people are important to the mob environment. He agrees to permit the drug dealing and offers protection just with one condition: at this time his son Sonny (performed by James Caan) was brutally killed. He accepts his dead as a part of the business and he is willing to make a truce to stop the blood spill. In one of the best scenes ever performed by Brando he stands up and says (not literally): ""I won't revenge my son's death. Mike, my other son is hiding somewhere in Italy and he will return shortly. I accept the conditions to bring peace, but if my son is murdered in any way, shoot accidentally by a cop, have a car accident or appears hanging in his cell I will blame someone in this room"" an then he signed his agreement with a huge with his enemy. A good movie with excellent cast selection, including a good performance of young Al Pacino and his incidental transformation from war hero to new family Don. Coppola created a myth with his trilogy. The second part was actually better than the first one and this is much to say. The baptize sequence at the end is just extraordinary. The initiation of the new Don receiving the holy water and holy blood. A new life, a new grandson, a new era. The end is just the beginning. The familia is not dead is just taking care of business as usual."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LagerLagerLagerShouting,10,22 July 2001,"The greatest American movie of all time, the Godfather marked a new era of film making much closer to the old studio system style. It was also an early example of a new appraoach to film-making ushered in by new wave of directing talent. Known as the Movie Brats, an including The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola and the likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, they were directors emerging through the study of the film medium in the 1960's and here it definitely shows.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jameshsara,10,25 December 2023,"""The Godfather, directed by the masterful Francis Ford Coppola, is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre. Marlon Brando's portrayal of the enigmatic Don Vito Corleone is a masterclass in acting, radiating power and vulnerability. The film's intricate storytelling, rich character development, and haunting score by Nino Rota contribute to its timeless allure. As we witness the Corleone family's evolution, led by Al Pacino's Michael, the narrative becomes an operatic exploration of power, loyalty, and the consequences of choices. The Godfather's influence on filmmaking is profound, setting the standard for crime epics. The meticulous attention to detail, coupled with stellar performances, crafts an immersive experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It's a cinematic symphony of storytelling, making The Godfather not just a movie but a cultural landmark that continues to captivate generations of film enthusiasts."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),darenok,10,19 January 2022,"A brilliant film consisting essentially of a trilogy of films and which we in Russia practically saw only 20 years later in the era of relative development of the video market. The fact is that the duration of each of the three parts is more than 180 minutes, for which a standard videotape is designed, and therefore black market dealers had to ""cut"" the plot of each film in those places that seemed less significant to them! In terms of its psychological influence and acting, the film just SHOCKED me! The game of Marlon Brando and the then young Al Pacino is simply amazing! Everyone who is trying to position themselves as a lover of GOOD CINEMA is SIMPLY OBLIGED to watch this film! It's just a pity, of course, that we will never see the film on the ""wide"" screen and with the sound of ""dolby surround""! For some reason it seems to me that many ""film critics"" on our website did NOT WATCH it at all or did not watch it completely. It is rather their misfortune, not their fault, that due to their financial situation they could not purchase video equipment (after all, in addition to even a cheap video player, an imported color TV was needed, showing in the PAL system - such a set cost at the level of new ""Lada"", and sometimes more expensive!) and super-expensive videotapes from ""distributors"" at a price of 90-100 rubles per cassette, which was a fabulous price for ordinary citizens! The ""First"" part is the strongest. We need her and the ""Second"". The ""third"" is significantly inferior to the previous ones, but this is the ""law of the genre""."

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people.

Each actor seems perfect for his role. The Baptism scene is one the greatest scenes in the whole movie.

Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised, 14 October 2006
Author: mattrochman from Australia
This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.
To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.
Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.
2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).
3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.
All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.
I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RodrigAndrisan,10,8 November 2018,"If you want to write something about this movie, either you write a complete separate novel, to express everything, or you just write 6 words: One Of The Best Movies Ever! But not the best movie for Marlon Brando. No, there is no ""Apocalypse Now"" neither! By far Brando is much better in: ""Morituri"" (1965),
""Candy"" (1968) and, absolutely phenomenal (especially in the scene when he's talking to his wife's dead body) in ""Last Tango in Paris""(1972). All the other actors are super exceptional: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Morgana King (Mother Corleone). But, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie is Al Lettieri in the role of Sollozzo."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),barisatasoy,10,29 June 2013,"The Godfather trilogy is probably the best movie series about underground mafias and families. Each part challenges the other by doing so,The Godfather Trilogy became the classics that will last till the end of the World."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dcTalker,10,4 March 1999,"By far, the best movie that I have ever seen (and that's saying a lot)... The acting, the story, the action, the family, everything!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vincentnlagace,10,14 September 2019,Oh my god this movie is a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola!! I'm gonna see this movie a few more times!! Go check it out someday it is so good!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jithuchandradas,10,9 April 2012,"the godfather is the best movie i had ever seen.I don't know how many times i watch this movie,maybe 20 or more. I think all the film lovers must see the film. Marlon Brando was excellent as godfather,but i like Alpacino most. His transformation from civilian to underworld don was terrific,and i cant imagine anybody else in the role of Michael. I don't know why he did not awarded an academy award for his portrayal of Michael . That's why i don't like academy awards. Tom Hagen is also very good. I liked the way Coppola directed it,as a lengthy movie i never get bored. I also watched THE GODFATHER part2, also a great movie and THE GODFATHER part3,which was not so bad as many says. Undoubtedly THE GODFATHER part1 is my best movie and i will never stop watching it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pmc69,10,7 May 2019,"For me the 2nd best movie ever made. only godfather part 2 beats this, pacino is amazing in this film. the acting by brando is also amazing."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),esduinmerino,10,13 April 2024,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),popokpop,9,31 May 2022,So of a Good Movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joelnoronha179,10,19 January 2024,"The Godfather is a story of what it is to be a man- to be feared, respected and to be one who stands by his word, who has to take care of his family and provide for them, stand with tem in difficult times and good times. Nice story, excellent representation of life shown in this movie. Shows people the life when they have everything also the life when they have nothing. Shows life before death and also also the scarry death. Very nice acting by the cast particularly Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. I am really impressed by the acting performances of all the actors on screen. Very nices storytelling, interesting, engaging and full of thrill and suspense. I had a good time watching this film. Didnt knew how fast time flew watching this film. I recommend this film to all men out there to have a spine and to never bow down to any foolish people, stand by your word and have the last say. I rate this movie 10 stars on 10. This movie is a crime thriller movie yet it is as much real and relatable to the audience. Family life, family struggle, every day problems all shown in the movie. This movie deserves a huge shoutout. Glad to see that this movie being so old is still fresh and releavnt to the todays audience. Evergreen film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johntheking2000,10,3 March 2003,"The first time I saw this movie was not too long ago.  Coming into the movie I'd heard lots of little things about the Godfather movies (mainly I and II).  Most, if not all, of my friends told that the second Godfather movie was better than the first.  I couldn't say anything then having seen neither, so I decided to see both.  After seeing both, my humble opinion is that the first one IS better than the second; however they're both very good movies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dostumbaris72,10,12 December 2013,"I know it is such a cliché to say it after thousands of comments, but this is a must-watch movie. You probably have seen all the impostors around acting like Marlon Brando which is funny of course but still it strikes you because of how much effort he put to pull off this movie. Although it might get boring sometimes, the acting and the sense of reality wind you up with the plot making it an easy-to- watch movie. Just to give you some heads-up, the first movie of the sequel can elevate the expectations for the rest, you won't regret for the time you spared for this movie. The plot is designated so well that it encircles you in every way not letting you stop or look away from the screen. In my opinion this is the best mafia-related movie in which all the racketeers and kingpins do not cut a swath and you admire even to the ones who die during the movie. Long story short, this movie definitely deserves its place among the top three in all time favorite movies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacey-10846,10,4 December 2021,"The name ""The Coppola Restoration"" says it all - because the complete ""Godfather"" trilogy for this Blu-ray edition has been extensively restored at the insistence of director Francis Ford Coppola. Since the original camera negative no longer existed, the best possible pieces were brought together from all parts of the world, subjected to film scanning on a 4k scanner and then polished on thousands of individual images using the latest digital technology: Contrast and colors were optimized and coordinated with one another , Dirt particles removed and much more."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sadam-79164,10,6 September 2019,"If you haven't watched it, then you're missing something. Never have I ever felt like a movie could feel so real. Amazing in every way."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jonas Tigerschiöld,10,1 October 2001,"This is one of the most eagerly anticipated film series ever (along with Alien Saga, Die Hard etc) and marking Paramount´s greatest DVD effort yet. The First Godfather film involves the epic story of The Corleone Family, where each member is supurbly acted by a superb cast, top notch from the principle parts to the smaller ones. As head of the Corleone family Don Vito (outstanding Marlon Brando) is ambushed and shot and put to hospital, his sons, Michael youngest of them, unwilling heir of the family top spot (Al Pacino), hot head oldest brother Sonny (James Caan), and quiet middle brother Fredo (John Cazale) must take control over the family business while he is gone, and rely on Don Vito´s new consigliere Tom Hagen´s (the always great Robert Duvall) and end the conspiracy bestowed upon them. The story is perfectly vowen, marvelously executed violence scenes. It´s a movie that must be seen by any movie fan, this is as perfect as movies become. No different is The Godfather Part II, even possibly better than the first one, this movie however is longer and is split up as two stories intercutting in parts, one showing the life and rise of younger Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and the other his son Michael tightening his grip on his family business, alienating his wife kay (Diane Keaton) in the 1950´s. The third and weaker of the Godfather movies but not all that bad, involves middle-aged Michael legititimizing his earlier crime business, while trying to win back his ex wife Kay. However new enemies within and outside the family ultimatelky corrupts the business and resulting in his retirement, as his son in law Vincent (Andy Garcia) ascend as the new Don, with the help of Michael´s hardened sister Connie (Talia Shire). The weakest performances come from George Hamilton as Michael´s new lawyer B.J. and Coppola´s own daughter Sofia as Vincent´s cousin and lover, which isn´t to say Sofia is all bad but doesn´t really have the experience for this pivotal role. The Video transfers aren´t all that top notch showing some grain but never-the-less show flawless detail and color resolution, the audio transfers are deliverd in powerful detail and gives the subwoofer a run for its money. The special features are all good and interests showing good value, Coppola´s commentaries on all three movies is as informative and interesting as they come, commenting on the cast behind the scenes facts, the how´s and why´s, his feeling about the third movie´s pointlessness. The facts are all here, the features as great as can be expected from a highclass trilogy such as this."

This movie is very strong, very good script, great casting, excellent acting, and of course great directing.

İt is very successful that mafia family, relating departments and citizens which are shown as reality facts in time condition of 1900s. İt is the most important point of the Godfather movie that people which are related closely with movie and novel, is successfully combined. Before you watched a movie, they should read Mario Puzzo's novel so you can exactly improve movie information. We can say that the most successful adaptation movie in Hollywood movie sector. Especially, when we look at the daily movie, we can exactly see the Godfather's importance and affects. I assume that this movie series affect all movie sector which are consist of actor, actress, screenplay, editor etc... I want to give an importance that the reality factor of this movie. We can not find the reality factor on daily movie because of the fact that computer science and using improved in movies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tamas-jobbagy-88,10,30 October 2013,"My favorite movie! Marlon Brando is great! Every year I look, I don't get bored! I still can say something new every time! Who has not seen very quickly remedied! Thank you Puzo and Coppola! Tom is my favorite character, because he sober, smart, and reliable! The greatest gangster movies, famous actors and director's work, one of the biggest Mafia movies of all time, The Godfather. The story describes the people and the machinery, which is rooted in the Italian Mafia, the world's most powerful and feared became a power in the United States. To keep tabs on the cruel killing methods, which work in the Corleone family head. Witness the incredible cohesion, the interests and fears of a cohesive force, which is characteristic of this world. Human destiny, life and death issue decided by Don Vito Corleone's study. Some are turning to high-Mr protection, while others come from a declaration of war. The rival mob, the Tattaglia family since the final showdown called the Corleone family. And after the declaration of war the whole city bursts into flames."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bretttaylor-04022,10,3 November 2021,"First of all there is not a performance in this film that is not excellent from Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and the rest of the cast right the way down to the dog running after the child on a bicycle on the suburban street. Al Pacino possibly gives in my opinion one of the greatest performances of all time. Michael Corleone a Man having just finished his service Wants nothing more than to have as normal life as possible despite being from a leading New York organised crime family."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),anthonywltrs,10,7 October 2022,The Godfather is one of the greatest films of all time and I know this sounds very cliché and predictable as it's been often repeated over the decades but there's truth to it. I remember watching this back in 2011 for the first time and my dumbass didnt like it and thought it was both boring and overrated
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TheOneManBoxOffice,10,11 August 2016,"""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cherryxie,8,23 March 2020,"Eight years later, it is necessary to revise my own views. The shabby ness is still, but there are also countless great plots and performances by the screenwriter and actors. You can also find that ""The Godfather"" brings audience a ""big screen"" experience which is enough to refute the opposition."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Faisal_Flamingo,10,3 November 2006,"I'm not a big fan of this masterpiece but I liked almost everything in it, I starting to love it though .. 1st time I've seen it I didn't really like it then re-watched it twice then really released how great this movie is .. one of the problems I had before seeing it that people told me almost daily how great it is and they speak with details sometimes which I believe is a big mistake because they really made feel that like if a miracle is going to happen and change the world as we know while I'm watching it!! besides, the biggest pleasure is to discover all the great things yourself so you can actually feel the greatness instead of faking it or something even if it takes you more than five times to watch it.. just be patient and try to see it as q movie and while you are watching someday you will know for sure how and why it is so great. In my opinion it is great because of Marlon Brando who gave one of the best performances in history of cinema .. the rest of the cast especially Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire did a great job .. Coppola did a great job directing and writing it with Mario Puzo and the music couldn't just be better .. the movie is great but it has also its down points .. so, I doubt it is the best movie of all-time. Enjoy it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lshankland,10,26 March 2018,Still the best. All gangster films and tv shows wish they had the class Godfather does
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),emanuelmarziadonadio,10,5 July 2023,"Best movie ever! I think that Coppola get his capolavoro with this movie. The Pacino's transformation its one of the most inspiring creative acting works for any actor or actress that who has ever dreamed of becoming an actor. Marlon Brando's performance is truly unique it was a revelation to my life to have known his work. You can watch the movie two hundred times, it's never gonna get any worse. The way Puzo weaves the script and takes it to the awkward areas where we have to accept that we don't want Santino or the gift killed. It's an act of mastery and mastery when it comes to writing a script and identifying with a mafia boss to the point that we feel part of the family. Duvall's work is sublime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),roynikhil18,8,14 January 2023,"The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),seanang,10,25 July 2015,"This Film is almost 3 hours long! I like the story, acting by Al Pacino and Marlon Brando but after I watch this movie on my TV for 1 hour, I start to look at my phone. The spoiler in which Vito Corleone died is dramatic( Which is a good thing). But after I watch this movie, I have mixed feeling, whether I felt happy that Michael take over the Corleone family or should feel bad after for the past 2+ hours that some of the character died in the end. But still, good effort by the director himself. When I think that when critics and people think that this is the best film of all time, I have some doubts about it, maybe other films like the wizard of oz or Forrest Gump might be better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saeid-najafian,10,18 November 2017,This film is the best movie in the world and it is wonderful and beautiful story and absolutely is one of the best act from Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. Every body most see this three films of Godfather. great story with great directing from one of the best director in the world Francis Ford Coppola.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MAINGEARid,9,29 May 2019,"Without undue emphasis, it shows the closeness, the warmth of family ties. The scenes are filled with wives and squalling babies, festive weddings and equally festive funerals, spaghetti prepared in the kitchen. There is the flavor of Italian home life that few gangster films have attempted. At the same time, there is also a specificity in the persona that few films have dared."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),doesdarknessmatter,10,8 February 2018,"In this Godfather's hyper-violent Waltz it is strictly business, kill, or be killed. The Godfather trilogy directed by Francis Ford Coppola is legendary among movie-critics and fans alike, and capturing generation after generation in the sad, and hungry world of mid-twentieth century organized crime. The casting is excellent with Marlon Brando as the legendary Vito Corleone, the namesake of this film: The Don, the Godfather. Following is Al Pacino's breakout role as Michael Corleone, the youngest of the three Corleone brothers. The story focuses primarily around the Corleone family as a whole, though Michael takes a primary seat as main character as the story progresses further. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ciuski,10,22 March 2001,"I'm not going to waste my time and my words on the plot or the summary of the film, but I'll write about the feelings that I proved watching ""the Godfather"". This film is a perfect movie and the cast is one of the best ever seen: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire... The majority of the actors are still appreciated and sought-after. The cinematography is wonderful; the soundtrack is very good (when I hear the trumpet at the real beginning I have the creep). I was really surprised when I read that ""the Godfather"" won only three Academy Awards: it should have won at least 10 of them. ""The Godfather"" is one of of the films that will be remembered even many years by now, and it's without doubts one of my favourite movies (with ""the Godfather - part II and part III"" and ""Braveheart""). Don't miss it!"

The movie has a lot of characters and it'll be hard to remember all of them so to get the real gist of the movie you have to rewatch a couple of time . But it's worth it . It's one of the best movies ever made in my opinion ."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),olcayozfirat,8,1 February 2024,"I haven't watched it stubbornly until this age. It's truly a legendary movie, except for the death scenes. Yes, they killed people 3-4 times in the death scenes. The man who took a bullet to the brain is still acting strangely. Apart from these, a legendary cast and a legendary movie. Many clichés in the world of cinema were born with this movie, I saw it. And these clichés are still used in the most important films and TV series. The music is incredible. Even if I didn't watch the movie, I knew the music. Even a car horn was made. But it became much more meaningful with the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),imurokks,10,19 August 2017,The best movie I have ever watched! I have watched it for the first time in Feb 2017 and could not stop myself from watching the sequels at a stretch. All of the 3 parts are very amazing. I liked the second part better where michael transforms into a don due to circumstances and he nails it. The first part is like foundation without which the second part would not have been that perfect. Everything is so flawlessly presented that I felt like I was living the story. This (Godfather series)tops my list anytime.

Music is one of the best ever (not just OST), camera is also brilliant, ALL actors are daring and stunning as director of this spectacle. And Fredo Corleone is adorable. Everyone, must see it, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone. 100%, 10/10, 5/5, 4/4 or how you want. Just...just WOW. Thank you to all the crew of the film, you are all worthy of an Oscar."

This is the film that started the career of Al Pacino and made a legend of Marlon Brando.  Director, Francis Ford Copolla shows how stunningly beautiful violence can be in film.  Also how we the viewer can see a little bit of ourselves in the twisted underground realm where passion and tragedy go hand in hand."

Castellano Robert Duvall John Cazale Sterling Hayden John Marley Richard Conte Diane Keaton)and the awards this film has won, its easy to understand why The Godfather is considered by many, The greatest film ever made. This film seems nail the balance of action, awesomeness and damn right brilliance. From the 'Horse Head on the pillow' scene to the 'Opening Scene' of Marlon Brando, this film just oozes with awesomeness! With all considered this film is simply phenomenal and its easy to see why its a permanent landmark in American cinema"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),digi-rush-solutions,10,14 March 2023,"""The Godfather"" is an iconic masterpiece of American cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and released in 1972, the film tells the story of the Corleone family, a powerful and ruthless Italian-American mafia clan based in New York City. The movie stars Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the family, and Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, his youngest son who reluctantly becomes involved in the family business."

I wonder at times if there will ever another great mafia/mob film like this and if so in what era and which filmmaker will achieve in creating that world. Only time will tell."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yassinhanini,10,11 July 2023,Arguably one of the best films of oat starring Legendary actors like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. I'd say it's suited to be the best gangster film there is. With roughly 3 hours of watching the movie keeps you hooked and entertained from start to finish as the story flows smoothly and in a really well paced way. In conclusion it's a must watch and it deserves the full 10 stars.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mongoose-6,10,9 August 1999,"Coppola's intense films are the stuff of legend and the sweeping drama of the Corleone family that was begun in this film is no exception.  The script is well written by Coppola and Puzo, who wrote the book, the acting is superb, and the little things like the lighting and the music add to the intensity and the drama of this film.  Al Pacino in pretty much his first role is superb as the straight war hero son of the Corleone Family who gets drawn into the ""business"" when his father is attacked.  Brando and Caan as well as Robert Duvall also deliver great performances.  The scene that sticks with you like the Baptism when Michael is having his enemies killed and its flashing back and forth between murders and the Catholic Baptism in Latin owing to the pre Vatican II setting is superb.  An excellent film well deserving of being ranked 3rd all time by the AFI.  The lighting is a superbly done job of being dark but light illuminating certain things much like a painting from the Dutch Master Rembrandt. All due respect to Blake Edwards but this movie is a ""10"""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bigskytct,10,22 June 2022,"A superb story, engaging and expertly crafted. The best actors cinema has to offer. Impressive directing moving us through their lives as if we are there. Topped off with one of the best film scores ever created. That is what this movie is, that is what allows us to completely suspend reality for two hours. Movies, films, cinema does not get any better."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iboss-x,9,14 December 2021,"I think that whatever I say, I do not give this great movie its due. It is truly a legend among films, Also, there are no films so far that blow up the style and workmanship and one of the best produced in the 2000s."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rawaldivyanshu,10,10 February 2021,This is an amazing movie that you can watch in any year and no matter how old this movie gets you are always going to love it.

When the film was re-released in 1997, Paramount was owned by Viacom, which placed its named on the re-release Paramount logo, and all subsequent video releases."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),austincolibaba,9,6 January 2021,"After finally watching this movie, I have to say that it was a little over the place with its plot. I feel as though the movie was trying to focus on too many things at once. The character build could of been better. For its time I can say that this movie would of been the best, but for 2021 and all the movies I've watched this movie doesn't even crack top ten IMO. I would watch it again with maybe my GF or brothers but wouldn't go out of my way too."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ivolarsson,9,25 May 2019,This movie have its own points that lead to conclusions!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),WhatsUpManPodcast,10,2 May 2024,"What sets The Godfather apart is its ability to humanize its characters and delve into their complex motivations. The film presents a meticulous portrayal of the Corleone family, exploring their dynamics, conflicts, and the moral choices they make. The characters are multi-dimensional, each with their own flaws, desires, and vulnerabilities, making them relatable and intriguing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tank31,10,12 January 2000,"I'll keep it short, this movie is perfect. The performances of all the actors involved, the many memorable scenes, the musical score. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and see it. Well worth the #1 ranking."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),oobtothewab,10,19 July 2002,"Francis Ford Coppola made his breakthrough directorial effort with 1972's Best Picture (according to AMPAS and numerous circles) is unquestionably the greatest american film.  This isn't to say that Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane aren't as good as it.  In fact, Apocalypse Now (also directed by Coppola) is probably better in terms of visual style and cause, but Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel THE GODFATHER) and Francis Ford Coppola's screenplay is surpisingly cohesive, and Gordon Willis' stunning photography accentuates the period feel of the film.  It is like no other work of cinema to come out of the 70s and will never be topped.  Not even by Coppola.  The story is so reminiscent of Shakespeare and Greek tragedies that Corleone seems almost mythological.  All in all this is a film about finding the American dream.  It's a film about honor, respect and tradition.  The word mafia is never used because unlike GoodFellas and Casino, this is not an expose or biography of the mafia, but is an epic story of an American family.  The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yuwenxiang,10,4 May 2020,"So classical movie. Old godfather and young godfather are not only two generation, but also the support of the whole family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ItsAtakan24,9,20 June 2021,"As I wrote in the title, this movie is not just a mafia movie. It is a work of art that demonstrates the importance of respect and that action is more important than words. I don't even need to go into other topics. The acting is super, the cinematography is super, everything is super. And I want to mention one more thing. I think the flow of the movie, that is, the math of the entrance, development and result, and the sequences of the scenes are handled very well and harmoniously. God bless hands of eveyone who contributed it. Watch it, show it."

Undeniably, a classic and will never become something you find boring to watch. When people tell me they didn't like it because it was too long, I feel like never talking to them again. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, two of the greatest actors to have ever lived. And a score to stick with you until the end. A classic for the ages."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dider,10,10 January 2004,"""The Godfather"" shows us all how high can the grade of a movie be. How a movie can become a standard and continue to rule over the years. Even in this edge of ultra- modern technology, ""The Godfather"" totally shakes the very basic of my movie knowledge. I've never imagined. Ever! It just takes control over my mind."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ike-16828,10,18 March 2018,This is a wonderful film I really enjoyed this movie
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sorawet,9,8 March 2021,"So great! The godfather it's one of the most revered movies of all the time and its contribution to cinema is remarkable. This movie will make you into the world of Mafia while being impressed by technical and narrative aspects. The movie based on the Mario Puzo Novo of the same name. Absolutely I loved this movie, it makes you enjoy with a story. It makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, the way of handling situation like a game, make your heart pound faster, sweat and relief. The way this the godfather presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance and falling everything. This movie will give you experience and aspect of life with characters.
The problem in this film is most people are so used to fast-paced films such as action film or series, it is extremely tough to hold their attention span for even less than five minutes unless something interesting or twist happen throughout the film. And the technicolor provides a memorable look for the film, the soundtrack is one of the most memorable in this movie. The performances in the film are amazing, as it features an amazing actor, and I like some scene such as scene of funeral, in this scene themed of soundtrack still remains iconic in my mind. So that this movie is one of a masterpieces classic movie of I have ever seen. I think the godfather is the greatest film in history, Godfather brilliantly weaves an intriguing look into the world of organized crime with innovative storytelling, direction and astounding performances."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abetancort,10,5 October 2013,"Simply you just have to see it. If there wasn't before this movie a ""mafia"" with a code of honor brought over from Sicilia to the US, this movie created it. Nowadays it's an integral part of North American folk history. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),svprotoblr,10,28 June 2023,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cheffychic,10,4 July 2001,"The Godfather has been a tradition in my family forever.  Even when I was young I wanted to see what this ""wonderful"" movie was like.  Finally, when I was eight, my whole family got together on New Year's Eve to watch the trilogy and The Godfather became my all time favorite movie.  There is nothing better.  I've seen the movie a million times, and never get tired of it.  I also enjoy watching the little documentary before the movie, but that totally spoils some of it if you haven't seen it before.  My family says I like Part 1 more than Part 2 because Marlon Brando was in it (yes, partly, but he's my favorite actor), but the story was so much better.  Many movies that are based on the book tend to add ridiculous scenes, but the Godfather kept true to the story.  All of the actors were wonderful, and now, the Corleone family is like a part of my family."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ayushchaurasiyask,9,29 October 2020,I like the screen play of that movie it is just not a movie it is the best play ever I watch any movie before with this type of screen play
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SoHo1,10,13 February 2005,"The Godfather is literally the most highly rated movie of all time. I liked this movie, adored it. And with all the respect that I have for this heavyweight striking flick, my sub- conscience tells me that there seems to be an overrating that simply has been unable to be tamed down for years. First of all, this is a great gangster movie with the most common characteristics of a mafia circuit. Superb acting is harshly evident with a small dose of surrealism. This is everything a true-life movie needs to have. But, still, I think that this is somehow one-dimensional and self-appreciative. It doesn't have a universal sense of mafia mob but remains within the confines of a single direction of storytelling. It concentrates on the Italian mob, a single family and no further. It depicts, marvelously, the structure of that-time mafia entourage and the set of rules it was based upon. However, I think there have been several other movies which, if not as subtly as The Godfather, precisely have managed go beyond the classic understanding of mafia and grasped a wider span of this topic. Anyway, The Godfather, though overrated, still remains self-contained and deserves to be one of the best but with all this time having passed by, not the best one. 10/10"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RafViziev,9,27 October 2022,"Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of astounding. Many of the decisions he made, such as the way he shoots the film, the casting, the screenplay, which he also wrote with Mario P, it's all done brilliantly. The technical aspects will also make you impressed. The cinematography is done beautifully and the use of Technicolor provides a good look for the film. The editing is also done well and the soundtrack by Nino Rota is one of the most memorable scores in cinema history, as its almost funeral-themed opening track still remains iconic and fits the film's overall tone. Of course I recommend it!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vermaksltd,10,29 December 2018,Probably one of the best movies ever made! so its 10 of 10 from me. Wish we could have more good movies like this one now days.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),senemgozde,10,17 July 2023,Baba is the iconic movie for me. I can watch every day . It's really amazing movie. When I watched at firstly I was child. And impressed me soo much. Also music is so Iconic. Most people still use this melody for ringtone :) When I started to the acting courses I learned something about Marlon Brando. He was reading his dialoges in front of his partners. They was sticks his dialoges to partners on. And he was reading from there. Althought read them he is really succsessfull actor. Also when I searched his old photos he was soo handsome. I am not think his succsess not suprise he is really amazing actor.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gnperuti,10,1 May 2024,"If there's one film for which the phrase ""best ever made"" seems like a massive understatement, it's The Godfather. This film is pretty much as close to cinematic perfection as you can possibly get. From the very first moments, with its beautiful theme playing on trumpets, it hooks you and doesn't let go for the next three hours. The opening is possibly the best I've ever seen: the first thirty minutes does an incredible job of establishing the setting, characters, and plot points, major and minor, all through dialogue and interactions. From there, it's a roller coaster of exceptional storytelling and character development that's endlessly captivating. And at its heart is the story of one man's rise to power coupled with the start of his fall from grace. Michael starts out as an honest man who wants nothing to do with the family business. But, as their enemies move in on them, he gets roped into that world in the worst way. After seeing the ugliness therein, he makes plans to make the family legitimate, but starts to go too far in his methods of doing so, starting a downward spiral that only gets worse as the series progresses. It's a brilliant character arc that I could probably talk for hours about."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nicolasbaldelli,9,18 October 2017,"The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),afonsobritofalves,10,13 September 2018,"The best movie ever, and if you're reading do not agree with it, you have bad taste.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gaurav1112002,9,26 September 2013,"The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning the years 1945 to 1955, centers on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while also chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando). The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema[3]—and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre.[4] Now ranked as the second greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute,[5] it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990.[6] The film was for a time the highest grossing picture ever made, and remains the box office leader for 1972. It won three Oscars that year: for Best Picture, for Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990. On the day of his only daughter's wedding, Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael, in a Marine Corps uniform, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the sprawling reception. Vito's godson Johnny Fontane, a popular singer, pleads for help in securing a coveted movie role, so Vito dispatches his fear, Tom Hagen, to the abrasive studio head, Jack Woltz, to secure the casting. Woltz is unmoved until the morning he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas 1945, drug baron Virgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzo, backed by the Corleones' rivals, the Tattaglias, asks Vito for investment in the emerging drug trade and protection through his political connections. Vito disapproves of drug dealers, so he sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. The family then receives two fish wrapped in Brasi's vest, imparting that he ""sleeps with the fishes"". An assassination attempt by Sollozzo's men lands Vito in the hospital, so his eldest son, Sonny, takes command. Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen to pressure Sonny to accept his deal. Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on his father at the hospital, but is accosted by corrupt police captain McCluskey, who breaks his jaw; Sonny retaliates by having Tattaglia's son killed. Michael comes up with a plan to hit Sollozzo and McCluskey that his brother approves over Hagen's objections: on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael lures the pair to a restaurant, retrieves a planted handgun and murders them. Despite a clampdown from the authorities, the Five Families erupt in open warfare and the brothers fear for their safety. Michael takes refuge in Sicily, and Fredo Corleone is sheltered by associate Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on the street for abusing his sister Connie. When it happens again, Sonny speeds for her home but assassins ambush him at a highway toll booth and riddle him with submachine gun fire. Michael's time abroad has led to marriage to Apollonia Vitelli. Their euphoria is shattered when a car bomb intended for him takes her life. Vito, saddened to learn that, despite his hopes, Michael has become involved in the family business, decides to end the feuds. Believing that the Tattaglias were under orders of the now dominant Don Emilio Barzini, he promises, before the heads of the Five Families, to withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo revenge for Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home and over a year later marries Kay. With his father at the end of his career and his surviving brother too weak, Michael takes the reins of the family, promising his wife to make the business legitimate within five years. He allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises even as he plans to move family operations to Nevada and delegates New York business to members who stay behind. Hagen, upset when Michael replaces him with Vito, is mollified by the older man's reassurance about their long- range plans for him. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, Greene derides the Corleones as a fading power. To add injury to insult, Michael sees Fredo falling under Greene's sway. Vito collapses and dies in his garden while playing with Michael's son, Anthony. At the funeral, Salvatore Tessio arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini, signally his treachery as Vito had warned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's son, to whom Michael will stand as godfather. As the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins, acting on Michael's orders, murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is told that Michael is aware of his betrayal and taken off to his death. After Carlo is questioned by Michael on his involvement in setting up Sonny's murder and confesses he was contacted by Brazen, Peter Clemenza kills him with a wire garrote. Michael is confronted by Connie, who accuses him of having her husband killed. He denies killing Carlo when questioned by Kay, an answer she accepts. As Kay watches warily, Michael receives his capos, who address him as the new Don Corleone."

The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings.

Each time I listen to the melody, I think about the heart of this film: how a father teaches the sons; how a boy becomes a man; how a man falls in love with a woman at the first sight; how a man deals with love, revenge and responsibilty; how a man protect his family."

Since watching it for the first time barely nine hours ago, so many specifics and situations have been bouncing around in my thoughts. There isn't a single thing wrong with The Godfather; in fact, it's so well-made and played that I'm having a hard time coming up with a decent enough excuse for why I hadn't seen it sooner."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fzulkadiroglu,9,28 May 2022,"The godfather series basically divides its characters into strong and weak. But while doing this, ""Fredo's weaknesses so that the excitement will come to the story."" or ""I need a sensible man to handle this Tom."" there is no thought. There are situations brought by the development of each character and as I said, you can see the logic of all the characters with a single rule. What is this rule? ""Hard times make strong people, strong people make good times; good times create weak people, weak people make hard times,"" writes Michael Hopf. Can be explained in words. Now, let's go through the members of the corleone family, how this word has become a spelling mechanic one by one."

It's not just about just any random gangster films. It's about a man named Vito Corleone, a man who do other people's favour, a man who believed in America. Those whom the Don helped called him ""The Godfather"" because they are indebted to him. When an attempt on Don's life happened, his son Michael decided to kill the man who shot his father through the support of Older brother Santino. When that happened, He is forced to flee the country because the war happened and Don Corleone was recovered from his gunshot wounds but decided to hand over his empire to Michael who returned to the country after Santino's death and learning that his father is sick."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TERMINATOR180,8,31 July 2001,"When I first tried watching this movie, it was 3 AM and I could barely pay attention, and it seemed too long for me to watch. And then I watched Scarface, another very long Pacino movie, and I loved it. That movie helped me get used to long movies, and Pacino movies (it made me a huge fan of Pacino) so I tried The Godfather again, this time renting the newer THX Remastered version (which has great Stereo Sound, by the way) and I watched the whole thing, paying attention all the way through, and I loved it. The key to surviving parts of movies that aren't ""action-packed"" is to pay attention to the background. Soak it all up, the area, the surroundings, sometimes beautiful scenery (in which there is alot of in another great long movie, The Deer Hunter) If you haven't seen this movie, you should, don't be distracted by the ""hype"" the movie recieved which might make you think that's all it is, because all of the hype and spoofs it recieved were due to the magnificence of the film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adharky,9,24 January 2019,"A timeless film, so current at the time it was made as it is today, magnificently presents us with the backbone of a system that still remains, a corrupt system, the film also speaks of betrayal, family, and above all, Friendship."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Anry7,10,24 December 2021,"Among the all time greats for sure. As a major mafia/gangster movie fan, this may be my favorite and easily a top 5 of all movies I've ever seen in general. See all other top reviews for more sophisticated descriptions."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Blaike,10,20 May 2018,One of my favorite movies. I used to watch it all the time. It is and always will be a classic.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kritikakis,10,4 May 2013,"A bit over-glorified as far as ""crime families"" are concerned, nevertheless, acting is top, cinematography is top, and it does have characteristics that made it part of modern Western culture. This movie has no flaws, even as far as its ""message"" is concerned."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),OrangeSequins,10,30 April 2023,"Why is ""The Godfather"" so highly rated? There are several reasons for this. For example, the great writing. The nearly 3-hour film has a great story: the twists and dialogues are nearly perfect."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dirtydanthejacketman,10,2 January 2004,"I truly loved The Godfather and I'm 14. The movie is absolutely hard to dislike, ex. great acting, great dialogue, great way of ending the film. I can't believe this film got only 3 Academy Awards. It deserved a lot better than that. James Caan should have won Best Supporting Actor. He was excellent as he was aggressive.  Yes, this is the greatest film of all time, better than Citizen Kane, which was a very good movie as well.  What I most loved about The Godfather is that it is completely original and unforgettable. If  you don't like it, ""I'll give you an offer you can't refuse."" Ha, ha."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lengjingyidianba,9,13 May 2020,"Without a doubt one of the greatest and most important films EVER made. But one begins to think if its ""timely values"" still quite hold up in this day and age? I guess only more time and vengeance will tell."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),crazyguyjk,10,20 November 2004,"Nope. It is, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made. It has everything you ask for in a movie. It has drama, action, comedy, etc. It has it all. The best thing of all might be the one that holds it together, the story. I remember watching this when I was younger. Although I liked it then, I love it now. It gets better after each viewing. It is not for everyone though."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mop59136,10,20 December 2003,"This is the best movie ever. The directing is perfect, the actors are perfect (Marlon Brando, unforgetable acting)the story is beautiful. This movie is just perfect. The final scene is amazing."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GermailStubbs,10,4 May 2024,"Great Work!! This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions."

A film based on Mario Puzo's book of the same name, directed by Francis Coppolo (who became a great Hollywood director thanks to the film)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xanderlm,10,16 October 2021,"The best movie ever, it's a GREAT movie! Marlon Brando gives a great performance as Don Vito Corleone, so does Al Pacino and Robert Duvall, it is the best drama in history, it is a classic! I absolutely loved the story! A Mafia known as the ""Godfather"" who hands over his criminal empire to his son, Micheal (Al Pacino) and things go wrong! Brilliant! SO brilliant! It's very long but very good, Francis Ford Coppola, thank you So much for directing this masterpiece back in the 70s, and bringing the best actors: Pacino and Brando, especially Robert Duvall ! I wish that there were more but to-be-fair, if they brought more, the newer movies would probably be like 1% on Rotten Tomatoes! And also, fun fact: Francis Ford Coppola is still alive and 80 years old right now! It's good to hear that, man!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),buvlol,10,19 January 2022,"The Godfather is a classic of cinema, no one can dispute this, and the fact that he became an example for all directors for many years. As well as an example of quality cinema and set a high bar for everyone."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),selcukry,10,2 September 2019,"That's a little to what the film says. The film is like a work of art. For the first time in a movie, I've seen all the actors play well. spectacular script and acting, management. A big hand for everything."

This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),muhammedakay,10,7 February 2019,That's awesome movie for everytime. And absolutely must be watch. Thank you.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),socialcosmoltd,10,28 November 2020,"The violence is over all, a bit less agressive in this film, and there is definitely much less sex. The language is a bit more harsh, but language happens, and there is probably more language at your middle school or high school than, in this movie. Other than one scene, any teen could watch it. When (don't want to give spoilers) a guy is talking to an old man. he sticks a knife into the guy's belly and moves it up to his neck. It shows tonnes of blood pouring out of his belly and the man leaves the knife in the man's neck. This is why this movie is not for children and definitely deserves a hard r rating."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),apexadam,9,4 April 2022,Each decade of my own life brings out more nuances of understanding the life of this fictionalized mobster classic. Love the depths of characters and the skilled role play.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),unimportantbadger,10,3 July 2006,"If you are only able to watch two movies this lifetime, this is one half of them. The Godfather is pure movie gold, a flawless masterpiece that only ripens with age. It'll just blow your mind how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously good this movie is. The other movie you must watch is the godfather's brother. The Godfather Part II. These two movies combine to make such a movie experience that cannot be simply explained with words. No other movie series has complimented each other better than these two movies, they fit together like a two piece puzzle. Begin a better life right now, watch the Godfather 1 & 2. You don't have to watch the third if you don't want. It's...not that good."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samc-54908,10,23 March 2022,"I recently saw this in cinemas for the first time, andi was blown away. Every aspect was just incredible, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography. Its all superb."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dlazarus-13304,10,11 February 2017,"Best film ever, greatest cast, the soundtrack and cinematography.I have seen this movie probably 100 times and each time I capture something new.Marlon Brando is the greatest character and an example of a wise mafia boss."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SabruLaEstrella,10,29 December 2004,"It has been around thirty years since the movie was released. Even longer ago was it written. A movie this memorable is not just another trilogy. The Godfather has everything. Cinematography that is impeccable, old stars, new stars, plot turns, fantastic acting, but most importantly realism. The characters are real in the viewers mind. We see them grow, especially if you follow the story into The Godfather Part II, and we see their personalities and reactions."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),simoncappi,10,23 September 2018,"It's a fantastic crime film. i love it too much, i think that is one of the best criminal film in the american history.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thevhsstrikesback,10,10 June 2020,I initially watched this trilogy in a VHS collectors edition that was in time order so most the Godfather 2 came first with De Niro. I loved it then back in the 90's then watched it multiple times as in cinematic release order.

the story is huge, the structure is flexible, the composition is exquisite. The essence of a movie is the art of telling a story. In a limited time, it is vivid and full to tell a complete story. In a movie, you can see the life of others, and it seems that you have finished your own life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vikasgami,9,9 October 2017,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life I love this movie and all of the GF movies I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly) This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kevinorrell99,9,9 March 2018,I want to point out that there is a flaw in this movie which everyone seems to be flawless; when Sonny chases down his brother in law and beats him up he takes a swing at him and misses his face by more than a foot. I am surprised this was let go. For me it sucked a bit of magic out of it. Still one of the best films ever made but I wish people would stop calling it flawless
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wetzel,10,1 July 2002,"I know the title ""the greatest film ever made"" is thrown around too loosely, but The Godfather is the one movie that deserves it. It deserves it's place at #1 in the IMDB's top 250."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Samuel-Shovel,10,15 January 2018,"After all the hullabaloo I've heard regarding this movie, I came in with fairly high expectations for obvious reasons. That being said, I was still thoroughly impressed but what this one had to offer. The acting in this is top-notch and I wouldn't argue with anyone who tries to claim that this is the best acting and cast in cinema history. Sure, Al Pacino has more screentime than his counterpart Marlon Brando, but Brando's commanding presence permeates through this entire movie, long after he's been in his final season. There's no question who the true star of this one is."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shahfarooq-04163,10,3 September 2021,This is a great offer and should be taken advantage of immediately.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),monqeth,9,12 November 2017,This the greatest film you can ever watch. Starting from the actor .. moving to the team and technical they used that time. It is amazing and unbelievable they did such a beauty.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),profmpiya2013,10,18 November 2013,A great movie that takes us into the life of the underworld bosses. Really depicts the real life happenings of the mostly glamorized life of crime bosses.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AznDreamCATCHA,10,12 September 2001,"Possibly the best mob movie, and possibly the best movie you will ever see. This movie has plenty of mob violence and extreme thinking to find out the enemy that hides in the shadows.  Marlon Brando is possibly the best actor you can find for a godfather.  The unexpected son Michael becomes the Godfather and is violent and will destroy whatever enemy opposes the Corleones.  It also had a great ending, where the two people kiss Michael on the hand, where he is officially the Godfather.  Great movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ratonuu,10,11 August 2017,Best movie i've ever saw in my life. I was in school where my schoolmates told me about this movie and i was so excited to see what is about it and when i get home i watch it online and was the best experience in my life. Hope these guys will make more parts because this move was excellent.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Z-Dawg,10,2 March 1999,"The Godfather is probably the greatest movie ever made.  It combines astonishing acting by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, but it also has one of the most captivating stories ever told.  There aren't many movies where you feel sorry for the bad guys when something bad happens to them.  I especially like the way that Frances Ford Coppela makes you feel like part of the Corleone family.  This movie has some of the most memorable scenes in it.  Who can forget the horse's head, or the bullet riddled Sonny lying in the middle of the road?  This movie definitely deserves repeat viewings, along with its sequels."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),danieltracy,10,19 September 2018,"Just about as great as a movie's ever gonna be. As for the storytelling, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mohammed_Iqbal_Y,10,13 May 2019,"The Godfather is an almost perfect film. Almost all aspects are done perfectly. A neat plot and a good storyline. Use of property with totality. In the ranks of acting, all actors are able to play such extraordinary roles. Both Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall managed to play their roles very well. Al Pacino, for example, who succeeded in turning into a cold-blooded mafia leader, or Marlon Brando, a charismatic figure and very family-like who succeeded in playing the leader of the mafia network, who was wise in making decisions, is also the main attraction of this film. But what was more surprising from Marlon Brando was his expression, I don't know how he formed an iconic facial expression."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),elenaiulianaaldea,10,11 May 2020,"I've never seen The Godfather from the beginning to the end until today. I was really impressed with how well it holds up, it is really well made and I enjoyed it a lot. This movie is timeless. I really liked seeing a young Al Pacino and Diane Keaton. It was like going back in time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tinyyellowthingtofollowgru,10,9 January 2024,"""The Godfather"" is one of the most praised movies in cinema history. It gives everything that critics and audiences alike ask for in movies. In my opinion it gets all the attention it gets for being one of, or the best movies ever. One of the best things ""The Godfather"" does is its incredible casting and its iconic performances from each and every one of its characters. The actors are so convincing that it won the movie several academy awards. It also jumpstarted several actors, acting careers, and gave an incredible ending to others. The Characters in the movie are outstandingly well handled. Each Character has somewhat of an arc within themselves, it shows each of their worldview and opinion of the situation that they face. It shows how their opinions, worldview, and personalities conflict with each other, and the consequences for reckless, illogical, and sudden decisions made by various characters. The film also gives the greatest character arc literally ever, through Michael Coralone, played by the incredible Al Pacino. The Godfather takes the viewer behind the closed doors of the Coralone crime family, a powerful Italian mafia group, and explores the pros and Cons of the organized crime lifestyle. Somehow through the immoral lifestyle that this movie bases itself upon, through things like narcotics, prostitution, alcohol, and violence it deals with very evident moral issues that we still face today, and does it in a somewhat redeemable way. The movie is also able to maintain a complex story with several moving parts, while also developing a very slow paced story. Therefore it spends time to dissect and flesh out its Characters and plot. It gives you a lot of time to interact and emotionally connect with its Characters, so that when they are lost it leaves a lasting impact on the viewer, and changes your view on the movie, and shows how it affects each of the characters involved differently. Another one of my favorite components of the Godfather is the cinematography and atmosphere. Its usage of crucial elements such as casting shadows and lighting communicates the dark essence that the film is going for, culture, and immorality, but always is able to communicate a sense of hope throughout. ""The Godfather"" has a very accurate portrayal of Italian culture and ways that culture is established within Immigrant America. I really enjoyed the cinematic representation visualization of organized crime and the abundance of style throughout. Speaking of style, another way the film communicates style and Italian culture is through the score. Just like the cinematography, the score communicates style and Italian culture, and accurately represents the way we visualize culture, crime, and atmosphere. ""The Godfather"" holds the best and most detailed character arc I have ever seen. You experience progressive stages of complete transformation through the changes of worldview and personality over the long period of time that this film takes place in."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),troy-daniel-bush,9,24 November 2019,This is a legendary film and I don't think I have to sing it's praises. However...
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mkabir-09245,10,20 December 2019,I would love to see a remake of this series sometime in the future.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rajabon1955,9,27 October 2006,"The Godfather is a great piece of American cinema. It shows the rise of Michael into the position of Godfather. The story is told with great acting, cinematography and music. SHould be on everyone's to watch list."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ericglunneborg,9,17 May 2004,"Well what is there to say about this movie?  Is it still the top movie on this site, or is it not?  Personally, it is not one of the reviewer's all time favorites, but it is still a very good movie.  One significant  detail of this movie, is counter culture.  The movie is filled with it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GetWrekt01,10,31 March 2020,"What an absolutely marvelous movie! Ford Coppola is truly an amazing director, and so are the entire cast of The Godfather. If it weren't for the second film of this franchise, and also Goodfellas, I would've undoubtedly dubbed this as the best crime drama of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),santanubhowmik-44055,10,28 March 2020,Crime genre movie with excellent cast and outstanding direction which makes me watch the movie again and again...won 3 academy award...based on the novel of Mario Puzo.. though the movie revolves around mafia family but not for those who are looking for a family drama..

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Berk_Alan,10,24 May 2024,"Unquestionably the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema! An saga about power, family, love, hate, business, in other words, about life itself. A rare example of a book adaptation. The movie, which inspired many projects, was able to stand upright despite the difficulties it went through during its production and brought endless fame to its creators. Especially the legendary acting of Marlon Brando as the Godfather and the choices he made for the role gave the movie a completely different dimension. Al Pacino's calm but stormy gaze, Sonny's brutality, the trust of his beloved Consiglieri and, above all, the ruthlessness of life and the mafia are beautifully portrayed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xedienducanh,9,8 November 2022,"After watching the film a second time, take careful notes on the formal and thematic elements of the film. Then attempt to create a central idea for your review that brings together the film's formal and thematic elements. If your second viewing does not yield a strong central claim for the review or if you need to take more notes, you may have to watch the film or parts of the filma third time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MrPacino,10,29 March 2013,"You may be wondering what all the fuss is about. Allow me to explain. What we have here in The Godfather is a film that is flawless in mostly every area. A film so deeply ingrained in our pop-culture that we aware of it without a direct mention. It takes a rich, deep, and intimate narrative; mixes it with stunning performances from a brilliant cast; adds the startling and intense direction of Francis Ford Coppola, and finishes it all off with an array of imagery and dialogue that is imbued in every film lovers' mind. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sanjay_Raina_1505,8,24 June 2023,"It is an extraordinary film that showcases the power of storytelling and the art of filmmaking. With its mesmerizing performances, breathtaking visuals, and profound narrative, it leaves a lasting impression on the audience. This cinematic masterpiece challenges viewers to embark on their own journey of self-discovery, unraveling the enigmas within themselves. "" The film encourages the audience to delve into their own enigmatic depths, questioning their choices, desires, and the true nature of their existence. However, for those who appreciate thought-provoking cinema that delves into the human psyche, this film is a true gem."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),svendaly,10,3 January 2021,"Tempting to give this less than ten so there's room to take it up a notch for part 2, but would be spuriously ungenerous.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MirSarwar,10,14 June 2019,It's among the best films i have ever seen and watch again and again. Especially for Marlon Brando. Its a masterpiece.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JBSdude,10,4 January 2005,"Probably one of the best films ever and easily one of the great films of the 70s. An all-star cast including Pacino, Brando, and Diane Keaton. Won best picture along with it's sequel. Also the best James Caan performance ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gardnernrg,10,15 December 2020,"Upon my decision to finally sit down and watch this film, I was well aware of some of the cultural influences made by this film. I was aware of, ""Make him an offer he can't refuse"" and, ""I don't get no respect"". I knew of these quotes and was pretty sure they were from this film. Solidified obviously when I watched, but I was also made aware of more quotes and clichés from this film. The horse head in bed, for instance. The voice and manner of Don Vito. So many iconic quotes and lines came from this film that it would be impossible to give it anything lower than a 10 just for that. And now, the film itself. The acting in this film was out of this world. Brando seems to become Don Vito as much as he is himself. Al Pacino is a new world of acting. His way of showing the inner battles Michael faces as he attempts to stay out and stay a good man is beautiful. The decisions he makes obviously affect him in many ways, and Pacino does this representation of conflict and struggles flawlessly. As entertaining and as high-octane as this film was, there was one piece of cinematography that I noticed throughout. This being the lighting of Marlon Brando. Throughout the film, Don Vito goes through a lot, from being the mob boss of New York to being bed-bound. The lighting of his eyes in his office, particularly, is absolutely breathtaking. His entire face is portrayed in this eerie yellow light which allows for some beautiful shots with cigarette smoke as well. But, this yellow light is positioned so perfectly that it darkens his eyes, so they are just black holes of emptiness. It gives the illusion of inhumanity, of heartlessness. Even outside at the wedding, his eyes are still sunken. However, when bed bound, the lighting is right in his eyes, and you can see right into him. This is merely one example of a probable infinite amount of examples of excellent cinematography that you could get from this film. One of my most entertaining watches ever, and somehow Coppola keeps me gripping the edge of my chair for 2 hours. An absolute must watch for any human being breathing air. A classic now, a classic then, and a classic for years and years to come."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lifeofdesmond,9,23 September 2019,"If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, ""The Godfather"" is it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),InlyCii,9,15 March 2020,"After watching the entire film of ""The Godfather 1"", I felt that it was exquisite, exciting, and inexhaustible, showing the exquisite skill of the film master, and the three-dimensional image created by each character, making this movie worthy of being called ""man ""The Bible"", the charm of the godfather 's character, what 's different is that all the benefits are exchanged and the family is right. The family view and the friendship with friends are deep, so that you can re-view yourself from your own world view. A far-reaching romantic gangster epic movie"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ww-12314,10,28 November 2020,"This is the best move of all time.I have watched it several times and all the graphics ,acting,story is just outstanding"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),slapshot-02239,8,15 September 2015,"The godfather is a great film that shows an accurate sense of crime during its time period. Almost very predictable but still very enjoyable, with many secrets through out the entire movie such as the oranges displayed before a death occurs is a very unique way to connect with the audience. This has been a favorite of mine since the first time I have seen it and it remains one of my favorite. Seems like a very hard movie to film with all of its different shots and angle throughout it keeps the audience on it toes and interested. I can watch this movie a hundred time and still be very interested. After watching it I left the room and i midfield expected to be shot down upon exiting the classroom. Once again just a fantastic movie and everyone should watch at least the first one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),doctorlorre,10,15 December 2020,"One of the best quality trilogies ever, maybe the best. When I first watched this movie, I questioned why I watched it so late. The acting is great, the production is great. In short, everything is great. Great movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),canermustafa,9,31 December 2023,"""The Godfather"" is an undeniable cinematic masterpiece that flawlessly weaves a tale of power, family, and organized crime. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Vito Corleone is nothing short of mesmerizing, while the film's intricate storytelling and compelling characters leave an indelible mark. Francis Ford Coppola's direction, coupled with a stellar cast, creates a timeless classic that transcends the crime genre. The meticulous attention to detail and a haunting musical score contribute to the film's enduring impact, making it a must-watch for any cinephile. Moreover, the film's portrayal of the mafia underworld is both gritty and authentic, painting a vivid picture of a world governed by its own set of rules!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Cinemaniac1984,10,30 May 2022,"Based on Mario Puzo's novel, Francis Ford Coppola's epic crime classic The Godfather still stands as one of the finest and influential films of the 20th century. The Godfather features an all star cast with Marlon Brando headlining the movie and also starring Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Diane Keaton."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mark-201,10,5 January 1999,"One moment stands out above all in THE GODFATHER (no not the horse's head). It is the slow zoom on Al Pacino when he is revealing his plan to kill Solazzo and the corrupt cop.  This is great characterization.  It shows Michael Corleone's development from a seemingly weak boy urging to forget his roots to a man ready to take the family helm. The Godfather is possibly the most brilliant film ever put on tape. Oscar winner Marlon Brando is great, but it is Pacino who steals the show in this one.  James Caan and Robert Duvall also offer up superb performances.  There are many other famous scenes in this one, including the infamous ""baptism"" scene. The Godfather is filmmaking at its finest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salmanragib-07528,9,12 August 2022,"The name is perfectly fit for this movie. This is the GODFATHER of all other movies. If you are looking for a movie that should forget you about time, this is it."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Joeserms,10,2 August 2018,"Pedra angular do cinema americano e mundial, atuações de peso e marcantes"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jtchiamp,10,14 August 2006,"In writing an apology for a film that really needs none, let me begin by noting how many careers were established with this movie, beginning with that of Al Pacino. Pacino had made movies before and was a respected New York stage actor, but this was his breakthrough movie. Brando was regarded as poison: he was impossible to work with, causing movies to lose money with his outrageous demands, so the studio execs despised and distrusted him. This movie, for which he had to suffer the humiliation of auditioning, resurrected him. It opened the door to the memorable ""Last Tango in Paris."" Of course we had all seen Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale in other movies, but this one made them stars. (I don't recall seeing Talia Shire before this.) And it gave Coppola the kind of artistic freedom that would lead to ""Godfather II""--another masterpiece. Puzo, who wrote the book and collaborated on the screenplay, would go on to do the scripts for ""Superman"" and other movies. It was magic for everyone who appeared in it. I am only sorry that the success it brought people like Marlon Brando and Richard Castellano led them to price themselves out of ""Godfather II."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erickmutura,10,21 January 2022,The godfather to me is the benchmark that I use to rate all movies that I watch. Its the very first movie that I can recall watching when I was younger.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),praveentirunagarii,10,7 February 2024,"What a Master Piece movie. This film can be called as the God of all movies in the world today.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Ethan-King-Crown-Books-NYC,9,18 May 2022,A wellcrafted movie this year. This is my first review and they are setting the bar straight at the back of those people who just finished the movie. The God Father is phenomenal and will expose a lot of things on the other side of the road and that I believe is one of the key components why it has created buzz all across the intenet.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rs9899,10,4 June 2020,"This is one of the best movies of all time. Direction, story, acting, even small things like camera angle and lighting are the best. Every scene of this movie seems to be worked on and executed perfectly. It has been highly rated in all of the movie rating websites and is a must watch for all the moviebuffs."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hetalpuniwala,9,5 March 2023,"This a movie which every Actor should watch. Performance, acting, direction, cinematography. Everyone please watch this movie at least once, theatre, drama, action.. everything is there. Bad as performance, creator and wonderfully made this movie at that time when movie is making. The family story line is awesome, and the acting of the protagonist was excellently perform by the actor, specially the child of the father, but this film is not about father and son or father and daughter but this is purely about actors life, kindly watch this movie and the underworld reality, the film set and cinematography and every actor performs wonderfully."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kori_superman_short,10,26 October 2017,"The Godfather is on a league of its own, giving a raw insight into the mafia world, this film will go down as the G.O.A.T! it is easily everybody's ""desert island"" pick."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rizkypf-97007,9,16 April 2020,"Everything is great! I don't know how to describe this movie. One thing for sure that this movie is aging like a fine wine. Someday in the future you watch this one more time and you won't be dissapointed, truly a masterpiece from Coppola."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jamesjustice-92,10,29 January 2021,"1972's ""The godfather"", or to be more exact ""Mario Puzo's The godfather"", was based on his own book and adapted to screenplay by him and the director, Francis Ford Coppola. The movie stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and many others and it received three Oscars for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Brando which he infamously rejected as a protest directed against misrepresentation of Native Americans in the movies. It was a fine gesture by Marlon considering that I personally would call his character a supporting one and Pacino's Michael was the true lead but that's up for debate."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),xristoslamia,10,12 April 2019,The best movie i ever seen !! I see it again and again !!! The Godfather is my favorite movie !!!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BARBARA49-1,10,16 February 2004,For me this is one movie I will never forget. Fantastic cast. AL PACINO showed how versatile an actor he is. He showed no fear.  You become part of the story. I would recommend to anyone. Everytime I see it  seems like the first time.  Mr Coppola put a lot work into it.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tresdodge,10,29 December 2004,"I love this film, it grips me from start to finish each time I watch it. For me it is impeccable without any faults, it delivers a wonderful family story encroached with the difficulties of a Mafia family."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rijkibudiman,10,6 February 2023,"L Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),barridgreenjr,8,10 April 2021,Loved the plot and the actors in this movie. They put a good cast together for this film as well.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),happybirthdaywishessms,10,14 September 2023,"Set in the criminal underworld of New York City, the film revolves around the Corleone crime family, led by the patriarch, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). At its core, ""The Godfather"" is a story of power, loyalty, family, and the moral complexities that come with living a life of organized crime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MattTK3,10,7 July 2003,"Believe me, for those don't have attention spans, this is a movie that is worth trying to overcome that shortcoming.  You won't be disappointed.  I was lucky enough to see this recently at the new American Film Institute's Silver Theatre and Cultural Center where I work.  Amazing.  The DVD set has some great extra features.  Also, look for the ""ghostly figure"" of Coppola during the funeral scene.  *****/*****"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),robinsstelva,10,8 June 2022,The must watch movie.

Fiction Mario Decided To Write For Michael In The Godfather. So It Is A Great Example Of The Creative Mentality Amongst Italian People During The Modern 20 Century."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jackfarken,10,16 February 2023,"The Godfather is beautifully crafted and definitely one of the best films ever made. Even the slight detailing you may miss such as the oranges implying something bad will happen to Vito Corleone. The transformation of Michael Corleone and the acting by Al Pacino is exceptionally brilliant. Tom Hagen is an excellent lawyer and friend to the Corleone family and he plays a crucial role. The balance of Vito being the experienced, Sonny being the rash, Fredo being the idiot and Michael being the intelligent is very well done. The audience need to see the different angles of the family and this is portrayed phenomenally in The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kurupt_yung_gotti1,10,8 May 2001,simply put it's the best movie of all-time and nothing else comes close.... it shows the power of the mafia and aslo the ruthlessness and the hurt that goes along with being in the mob....its a true italian movie and anyone who does not see this movie doesnt know good film making....

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bachtm,10,2 June 2019,Very good cript. Beautiful film just perfect:)......
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kyungsoon111555,8,10 May 2005,I am young so I still have lots of classics movies to discover. I've heard lots about The Godfather but here in my beautiful hometown DVD's can even get more expensive than somewhere else or in the US. So I've asked a friend who has the treelogy and I've eventually watched it and I've liked it very much. There is the violent bit but the movie also speak from heart to the hearts. The horse-head scene was scary and so were the scene with Sonny being shot with a crowd of bullet. Nevertheless there was this beautiful scene with heartwarming moments and history of Italian emigration to the Americas. I am looking very forward to seeing Godfather 2 and 3. If they are half as good I will write about them because beautiful movie need to be appreciated. Thank you for reading.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CristianDogaru,10,5 February 2020,I see him every time I have the opportunity. One of those films that lets you live the atmosphere and the action with the actors.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),everyday-04719,9,20 June 2024,I LIKE IT. A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mstepien-54061,10,7 February 2021,"I mean - Is there even a competition? Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, Citizen Kane - as great as these Films are, none of them even comes close to this Masterpiece. Truly cinema-changing gem wich does everything right."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Arinexus,10,24 November 2016,"The best movie of all time, because it shows what true character development is in a movie. The character arch of Michael Corleone through the movies is one of the best ever written. It succeeds not only in pulling off the use of a classical/formal/mannered film language correctly and remarkably; that language is used to emotionally evoke a grand archetypal American narrative, Operatic and Tragic, built around an immigrant family, and charting its rise, corruption, and fall in ways that comment on a vast array of subjects that relate to the American condition: Marriage, Politics, Poverty, Crime, Innocence Lost, Violence, Loyalty, Betrayal, etc. etc. So: It's a classical tale told nearly perfectly; with rich, soulful acting, magnificent cinematography, and insinuating, meaningful dialogue."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),monass-45627,10,1 October 2020,"The best movie ever made in my opinion, a pure classic with legendary actors in it! Must watch if you haven't."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Jess-24,9,28 November 1998,"A fantastic movie. Its moving and gritty storyline takes you through a wide range of emotions: happy, sad, angry, and fearful, although you can never feel for the characters. (For obvious reasons). I liked the sequel personally better, but not by much. The series should have stopped at #2, because Mario Puzzo's novel spanned the first 2 movies. See it instead of sitting at your computer all day. Now."

Hopefully, for the next part of the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LucianGagea,10,19 October 2006,"The Godfather is the best movie I ever saw. No movie in my entire life has made me actually live the life of the gangsters when I was watching it . I wanna thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola and most of all the Corleone Family for giving me the opportunity to see this amazing work of art . I recommend this movie to all people..... and I hope it stays in top a million years from now. Once you saw it you will want to see it again , and again , and again because no other movie gives you that feeling of ""I'm on top of the world"" . The actors.... what can I say... you already know that one of the best actors in the world are playing , with the master Marlon Brando ahead of all. All actors who play'd in this movie had a fulminating career in the next years. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hassan-ilahi,10,16 August 2011,"Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is perhaps the best gangster story ever told and the best film ever made. It's an enriching, engrossing, and evocative look into the criminal underworld in perspective of the Corleone family. This is also one of the rarest films to come out without any flaws. As far as it goes, The Godfather is literature for movie-goers and respectfulness for critics. It boasts legendary performances, excellent direction, a brilliant script, and a smooth, peaceful soundtrack."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erdy-49189,9,10 April 2016,"awesome movie. In mafia movies , but this film will only weapons and combat all processed very good script and acting. Processing of the rise and fall of a family . perfect crime and drama along with other films. A great movie that everyone should watch before you die. great processed as subject Marlon Brando was much better movie with great acting One of the few films awarded in three branches. The poverty of a man is the subject of short films and desire to stand against the influence of poverty and injustice is important to understand the ability to kill people and is proving its strength. It is a film that addresses the creation of a mob and growth"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jdstrat3,10,18 February 2005,"I would like to know what happened to this film and why was it edited and not available in it,s original version any more.I know Coppola edited it for television around 1976 and the standard version that is available now is a very wimpy version of the film I saw in 1972 and a few more times in the mid seventies.First of all the sex scene between Sonny and Lucy actually showed some nudity,where in the current version it just shows the end part.All of the foul language is all edited or overdubbed,and the scene where Sonny is assassinated is missing some frames and is less violent than it,s original form.I am a big fan of James Can and the scene where he gets the news of his fathers shooting has been removed along with where he tells his mom about it.After he gets the phone call from Connie because Carlo beat her again it cuts the part out where Sonny comes storming out of the house using the four letter word three or four times.This is also missing.The Godfather (uncut) is the best film ever made and was James Caans most searing performance.I would like to know if I can find it anywhere as I have been searching for over twenty years now and am deeply saddened that such a fine movie was ruined.Help please."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Braveheart1626,10,3 September 2001,"The Godfather, with its superb cast, (Brando, Pacino and James Caan) is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Marlon Brando changes his accent from an American to an Italian, which is so amazing.  Pacino is great, especially when potraying Michael, who dreams of going to college when he comes back from the army.  His dreams are shattered when he has to take over for his father, while Brando is in a hospital.  The storyline unfolds from there, and this movie is definetly a classic."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hmas_doug,10,30 January 2007,"This is probably my favourite movie. It really is tough to decide between the first 2 for the greatest, but i do think that this just has a slight edge, and i am also a huge fan of the 3rd, but its not quite in the same league. I just think that it's really mindblowing how awesome Marlon Brando is in this movie. That is probably the most deserved Best Actor Award ever, as this movie is probably the greatest Best Picture winner ever."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),isabellagiampaoli,10,4 October 2019,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jdperez-sol,9,30 November 2011,"I think this is one of the best mafia movies ever made. It has everything you can ask for: action, nice photography, great direction, suspense, and the best of all: a great plot."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aydinceltek-58835,10,19 November 2021,"There's no need to praise this movie anymore than it has been. Instead, I'd like to bring attention to the relevance it has to the crime genre. When we think of the 'tropes' of the organized crime genre in cinema, a lot of writers and directors pull from this movie franchise. I've even come across the tropes in the Godfather in foreign movies and series about organized crime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Reyhan5289,10,17 March 2022,"The Godfather is a film that is critically acclaimed to the point of reverence, and rightfully so. The writing of the movie is absolutely brilliant, it takes its time setting things up and developing its characters so that events that occur later on have an amplified impact. The outstanding score by Nino Rota is incredible, it is no surprise how popular the soundtrack of this movie is. Marlon Brando gives one of the most impressive performances I have ever seen. His portrayal of Don Vito Corleone was genuinely awe-inspiring. This is thanks in no small part to the dialogue of the movie which is simply stellar. The movie is absolutely brimming with nuanced and poignant lines."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),algebrastudio,10,21 January 2024,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is not just a movie; it's an experience. Released in 1972, it's become synonymous with cinematic brilliance, captivating audiences for generations with its operatic story of family, loyalty, and the corrosive nature of power."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jefriraymond,10,15 July 2023,"One of the best films I've ever watched. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, it is also liked by many moviegoers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),guipastura,10,15 August 2021,"It's hard to find bad aspects about this movie. It captures the mafia life perfectly, the actors are so good, the story is incredible and the drama is so fascinating that makes the movie extremely intriguing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sawan-48175,10,11 August 2017,"A master piece by Francis Ford Coppola and screenplay is fab. keep inspiring us and new film makers. The story writer put all inputs to bind the audience throughout the film. Cinematography and shots are well designed and executed by the makers. I watched this 5 times, first it was in my syllabus and then i loved it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shovon-32563,9,1 November 2022,"Casting was a disaster it seems, not confident to go with new actors, not bold enough to put money down for great known actors. It's a mixed bag, along with the delivery of lines and the scenes in general come across very flat and uninteresting."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),praveenputhanpurackal,10,21 July 2023,"The Godfather is so good because it is a masterpiece of a film that is held together firmly through a strong cast, world-changing cinematography, and the music that intensifies the strong theme presented in the film. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film."

When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lejlacizmic,10,9 June 2017,"The best movie of all time. Excellent acting and directing. When I first watch this movie I couldn't watch any other movie for long time, because all of others were crap. I can watch it for 100 times, but I will watch it for 101 time.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),all_mod_cons09,10,23 August 2005,".....for true cinema fans. I feel more like I'm just casting my vote to help keep this from being caught by ""Shawshank Redemtion"", which not only isn't even close to being the 2nd best film of all time (I was thinking more like ""Casablanca, ""Sunset Blvd."", ""Gone With the Wind"", etc...), but isn't close to being the best film of the 90's (Pulp Fiction, Schindler List)). the Godfather is the best film of the 1970's, which was itself a peak time for film creativity. the performances here are truly a shining example of the best in naturalistic acting. the cinematography is unsurpassed, with the dark lighting playing a key role. a lot of women mistake this for a ""guy movie"" or ""male fantasy"". maybe it is, but it isn't ONLY that. the choice we all face between our dual nature is fascinating and compelling."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),j_beaudine,10,7 November 2001,"""The Godfather"" is truly one of THE greatest films in cinema ever.  With the help of possibly one of the greatest casts, Francis Coppola's film is one that should not be missed.  It all involves the rise and near fall of a mafia family.  Many of the young talents have gone to other great roles. Among them are Al Pacino(who steals the whole film), Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and the late John Cazale.  And of course, there's Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone.  He deserved the win for Best Actor, though it might have been a little dumb to refuse the Oscar.  Pacino should have been the real winner for the role of Michael.  With some of the greatest scenes ever this is a must see."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jshcreek,10,12 June 2004,"Coppola's 1972 film ""The Godfather"" is an unparalleled cinematic masterpiece. No other film to date has combined violence, romance and music so seamlessly. From the intertwining plot-lines to the flawless and complex character developments, everything about ""the Godfather"" was pure viewing magic. Never before, nor since, have I seen a film of such grandeur and class. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),The_Godfather_,10,16 October 2002,"If you are one of those film-goers who do not have a long attention span, are not able to digest more comlicated dialogue and only appreciate mindless action thrillers then this film is not for you. For the rest of us it is the greatest movie ever made. 10/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NateW,10,15 October 2001,"As long as movies exist, The Godfather will always be relevant and stand out as one of the all time best.  When most people think of a perfect movie, this one comes to mind, and for good reason. Every single aspect of filmmaking is executed down to the finest detail with flawless results, most notably the violence, which is graphic but never gratuitous. The ensemble acting is arguably the best ever, with every performance being beliveable and memorable. The story of a mafia family trying to survive amidst a crumbling empire is very compelling, but it's much more than a mafia movie. It's a story about family and the importance of staying together."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmed_joey_10,10,1 October 2007,"I couldn't believe what people, critics, movie-sites are saying about it, cause I didn't think that one movie could have it all. But it had it, it deserved all what people was saying about and I am just proud to be writing a review on ;in my opinion, one of the greatest movies EVER made 'The Godfather'. What can I say...I never saw just a combination between action and drama in one movie, so I could say that the plot is definitely the best I've ever watched and may be will ever watch. Actors' performances were perfect, I mean what do you think of Al Pacino or even the better Marlon Brando's performance in any other movie? well, they were at their finest and reached their top acting talent in this movie. Also James Caan made a remarkable performance and especially that scene when he dies. Even the soundtrack and the main theme for the movie, I think nobody could ever forget this music and how it did fit the movie and the drama. By winning only 3 Oscars, I think that the academy awards really did underestimate 'The Godfather' as I believe that it deserves to be the most Oscar-winning movie in its year and may be one of the most ever....I just feel that whatever I'll say won't afford to describe such a legendary movie, but I must say that I recommend this to ANYONE who only wanna watch an excellent movie...."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aikyashah,9,26 April 2013,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacob rosen,10,7 December 2001,"At once an observant homage to crime films of the Thirties and Forties and a loving portrait of an Italian-American family, Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's superlative novel (Puzo also co-write the script) is an achievement few films can hope to approximate. Coppola, along with his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, and his production designer, Dear Tavoularis, have created a history wholly realized, burnished brown as if a memory that will never completely fade. The world of the Cosa Nostra they present is closed and stuffy which provides an intimacy that generates an extraordinary amount of warmth and a feeling of lives being affected. The cast is flawless: the actors, to a person, inhabit the characters with such understanding and affection that they will be forever associated with them. (Al Pacino as Michael in the trilogy will never be able to match this work elsewhere.) But it is Marlon Brando in the title role that delivers such devastating work that you can only sit and stare in wonderment. Brando has a presence wise beyond his years and his gentle, thoughtful manner is never once betrayed his calculating, violent acts. Every movement, every vocal inflection is detailed and planned but he offers a spontaneity that never reveals technique. Guided by Coppola's abiding dedication to realism, Brando pushes this film to icon status. Not to be missed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mariopv74,10,18 June 2006,"This is the one. The movie that sums perfection in 175 minutes. Just gets better every time I see it. Every bit of the film is precious and the movie's soundtrack is a classic. Just to hear the initial notes sends shivers down your spine. The conjunction of all this stars in one movies and the great performance given by each one of the actors is amazing. I love Brando's performance, and the way that Micheal Corleone's character is developing thru the film, Robert Duvall is great as Tom Hagen and James Caan as the hot-headed Santino opposite to everything that is Michael Corleone. All wrapped in a fine script written by Puzo which is really flawless. This is why I love movies."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Nancy-khoury,10,17 September 2022,"It could be argued that Francis Ford Coppola's film of Mario Puzo's bestseller, at once an art movie and a commercial blockbuster, marked the dawn of the age of the mega-movie."

I will advise everyone who haven't seen it yet just to go home sit on the crouch and watch it, because this is a fantastic movie!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),niths-87710,9,1 October 2016,"The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): ""Don't ever take sides against the family."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),antoniobencosme,10,16 August 2019,"In my opinion one of the best movies ever made, no waste from beginning to end."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sanjaymondal-22540,9,29 October 2020,A rare bit of humor within the trilogy and shows how nonchalant mob killings can be.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shajalalshakil,10,26 June 2022,"The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not promisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street)."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),theshuttlewoods,10,21 December 2000,"I remember when I was about 13 when I first watched the Godfather. I turned it off after half an hour. Three years later one of my friends had it on video. At first I was reluctant to watch it, but I became entranced by what I saw. Not only did it contain probably the best ensemble cast I have ever seen(Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton and Shire), but it is also one of the greatest stories in modern cinema. The predominant theme in this film is not violence or power as some might say it is, but family. Without giving the film away, the most moving and evocative parts of the film are when the members of the family are involved. I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Brando's work (Apart from 'Apocalypse Now'), but he deserved an Oscar here, for one of the greatest performances of our time. Caan, as the explosive 'Sonny' should have got 'Best Supporting Actor' too, as well as other magnificent performances by Pacino as Michael, and Duvall as Tom. Watch this film, you will NOT be disappointed. The greatest film ever? Probably-a definite 10."

None of the actors is less than perfect.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kacevskis,10,9 June 2013,"This movie is so epic. One of the best movies in the universe, that's for sure, worth watching for everyone. The actors are great, casting is great and plot blows your mind. Unbelievable experience. It's amazing that 40 years later it still holds up. It brings out different emotions. And Al Pacino is a wonderful actor. The Godfather is fantastic from start to finish, there isn't a single second that felt off to me. It runs for almost 3 whole hours, and each second is utter perfection. It's a testament to the strength of the screenplay when you can sit in one spot and watch the film for twice the length of most feature films and be totally riveted and enthralled the whole time. This is a long, long movie, but not a single instant is wasted."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jonny_boy,9,3 October 2005,"Fantastic movie. Incredibly rich storyline, repeat viewings reveal extra details that are echoed in the rest of the trilogy. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino usually receive all the plaudits but their fellow stars; James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duval also shine. It's also a fascinating movie in way of transformations. Al Pacino starts out as a 'nice college boy' who refuses to become embroiled in the family business, only to become ensnared when an attempt is made on his father's life. Pacino's change in character is carried off with credibility, both physically and verbally. I have seen the trilogy numerous times but I still want to see more! Well done Mr Coppola!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AllenD,10,22 March 1999,"This one has it all. The casting, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the plot twists. It is simply almost above reproach. Many say GFII is the better movie, but because it tells 2 stories instead of one, my nod goes to the original Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),harriseli-12221,9,19 November 2018,"This movie was well directed with great acting and character development. There were many plot twists that kept me guessing and made me want to sit through the lengthy film. Although, there were a few confusing jumps in time that took away from the overall experience of the film. This film set the mold of what many crime dramas would later follow.
The film had great cinematography, using appropriate colors for each scene's tone. The film's score also resonated well with the scenes it was played in. The actors did a great job of immersing themselves in post-war mob culture while maintaining good chemistry with their co-stars. In conclusion, The Godfather is a film with excellent cinematography, acting, music, and plot."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wilkinsshannon,10,19 April 2022,"This movie is the best yet. I watched this movie over and over again. The Godfather is one of the oldest movies, I every watched. Godfather I, II, III, mobster movie are my best movie."

That is by far the greatest film ever to give organized crime to a portrait, this film shows all of it inside out and goes deep in.With brilliant playing by specially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this film reveals how one among the mind mafia families in Ny works, it gives a comprehensive image of how their company runs and what sort an opportunities they got to take on their company, for instance their abnegation in step inside the narcotic company brings on a lot of problems, but additionally it reveals what sorta sacrifices they make, each day might be their last day.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),joelazongnissou,10,4 July 2023,Really loved watching it. Will definitely watch it again and again.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),liteskinprince,10,23 April 2006,"The Godfather has to be the best movie of all time. It not only captivates the criminal aspect but the loyalty and business savvy of a mafia family. This movie is also great because it was the rock of many careers of our most notable and best actors and actresses. Al Pacino, Abe Bagoda, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppala, Marlon Brando, and James Caan along with many others. Now whenever you see an organized crime movie anywhere it will be compared to the mafia story. This movie also teaches you some important roles to live by. Be careful who you trust. Also keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. If you haven't seen The Godfather trust me ""it's an offer you can't refuse."""
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),paulccarroll3,10,18 September 2023,"Oh Hubris, hoisted by your own petard. Violence begets violence, Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The first thing Michael says to Kay is Thats not me, thats my family. Oh self denial and delusion, of course thats Him too. Michael commits double murder to protect His father and His family. This leads indirectly to the murder of His brother Sonny, and His first wifes assasination, that was meant for Michael. This was the last straw in Michael's decent from innocence to degradation. His acceptance of violence to solve His problems is directly due to His fathers acceptance of violence, and ultimately His deception and lies lead Him to lose His second wife, Kay, the estrangement of His children, and to even killing his own brother, Fredo, the final decent into megalomania. This is what it all comes to. He loses everything that He loved, and wanted to save. This is one of the greatest films, a story very well told, and it's so sad! You cant turn away."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),babaeianr,10,18 June 2019,It shows what cinema art is and what cinema is not. The Godfather helps me to understand art better and i think it does its duty as good as possible. and i should say that this film shows golden ages of cinema too.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),temocanada,10,13 October 2000,"I've seen nearly 40 of the top 50 films on the AFI list, and although I'm no authoritarian on the subject I say without a doubt this is the most profound film in memory. If not for the fact that this movie is about Italians, better yet corrupt ones this would have been #1 on any virtually any reputable list. Everything comes together, there is no flaw. Citizen Kane was also brilliant, but it had flaws. How often is there a Godfather reference on tv? in a conversation? I can talk to anyone for hours about this film. This is the standard, this is the benchmark."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SPZMaxinema,8,25 April 2022,"I understand the significance of this movie and what it did for crime/mob movies that came after it. It was definitely well-made and I liked Al Pacino in it for sure. My favorite scene was when he shot Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, very well-done scene and very intense. Other than that it was good enough I suppose but I still like Goodfellas better and the other subsequent movies that The Godfather inspired."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jaaanmerz,10,9 November 2020,"This movie is truly a masterpiece; the story is riveting, the momentum and pacing are marvellous, the characters are interesting and it really does pay off what it sets up, however, it would take me forever to recite the list of pros. I do have a few criticisms though; this movie, while leaving out some elements from the book were a good call(such as Fanucci and Johnny Fontain's full story), my sisters say that Vito's death isn't as tragic and Michael's arch isn't as slow burn in the film due to the decision to keep out some of the scenes relating to these 2 concepts, but I think that the scene before Vito's death was enough for the movie and the swiftness of Michael's development was justified, however, they should have ties up Fabrizio's sub-plot better. Overall, spectacular film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DeeJayCritic,10,26 March 2024,This Film contains Splendid and Balanced Cinematography. Realistic and Comprehensive Acting and some of the very best storytelling with its twists.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),postolachivalentin,9,23 April 2021,The movie everyone has to say they liked (don't dare to say you never watched it) if they don't to go in a fight with a stranger.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brechtvw,10,17 March 2005,"I believe the Godfather is the greatest film all time. Marlon Brando, who at first wasn't interested to play Don Vito Corleone, put down his most stunning performance ever. The characteristics, the voice of Brando match perfect with the some kind of mysterious Vito Corleone. This film is also the real start of the career of Al Pacino. After he played Michael Corleone, he was immediately given the role of young cop Serpico one year later in 1973. The best actors of two following eras meet here in this film. But the Godfather is more than just Brando or Pacino. We must certainly not forget the brilliant performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, all Oscar nominated. John Cazale playing Fredo Corleone stays a bit in the background. I liked him better in part 2. Francis Ford Coppola puts all this great actors together in a beautiful whole."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrigchopra,8,26 November 2018,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.
BRILLIANT FOR ME 8/10"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),daviddaphneredding,10,19 June 2013,"This is, undoubtedly, THE classic movie of all time, and seems to set a standard for lines, effects, acting, action, and all other basic elements connected with any movie. With all due respects to the outstanding and late actor Marlon Brando, it was more than just he who made the movie an outstanding success, though he was convincing as the usually-calm yet almost-always cold, controlling don Vito Corleone The nostalgia effects were superb: it was not the least bit difficult to imagine what NYC was like between 1945 and 1955. (1971 NYC was ""turned into"" the NYC of the time setting of the story.) James Caan was as mean as mean could be in his role as the godfather Vito Corleone's son Santino, (Sonny) and Al Pacino, as the don's youngest and favorite son Michael Corleone, had his career launched in just this movie. Of course, Diane Keaton proved to be a promising future star in her role as Kay Adams at her young age of about twenty-five. The story came across as a story of, in my personal opinion, how NOT to live. (Of course, some would disagree with me one hundred per cent on that.) This in-depth study of the Mafia (though the word ""mafia"", as the case was supposed to be, was never used) was definitely a convincing view of the underworld with, among other things, the ""eye-for-eye"" mindset. To recapitulate, the nostalgia, the action, the acting, and the story itself made it THE great feat for Hollywood for all time. Paramount Studios, the director Francis Ford Coppola, and the producer Albert S. Ruddy should be proud."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thuecanhochungcu123,10,11 April 2024,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is widely considered one of the greatest films ever made. Released in 1972, the movie is a sprawling saga of the Corleone family, a powerful Mafia clan in New York City."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chrose16,8,1 March 2015,I had the chance to watch the first uncensored version. Breathtaking and a great historical flashback.

The actors, script, set design, costumes are all top notch and well worthy of the recognition provided by awarding of the Best Picture Oscar for 1972. MUST SEE."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),princewolsan,9,9 January 2022,It really is one of the all time great films for numerous reasons. But what really stood out to me was Al Pacino's performance. He's so good and brings out so much dynamic to Michael's character.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shubhampandey-58482,10,24 August 2017,"Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),therajdevkumar,10,25 November 2020,"In my view, this is not a gangster of crime inspiration film. I like this film about acting and cinematography. Brilliant work by actors and director. I think this film has the capacity for new generation moviemakers."

This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gunnernp,10,8 November 2022,Real life mob movie captures true to life life Mob crime. Very detailed with great acting! Superb cast! Definitely will leave you wanting to learn more. This movie sparked a Hollywood interest and paved the way for several other mob movies to hit the scene. Many of these actors are so convincing with their mob look and talk that they have starred in several other mob movies. With movies still being released to this date featuring some of these very actors. These movies feed into Americas fascination with the mob and keep people wanting to see more. If you are just starting into mob movies this movie is definitely the mob movie you must start with!

Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were absolutely outstanding!! And Godfather 3 was also the best movie ever! I have the trilogy set at home! I wasn't crazy about Godfather 2. It wasn't that great to me. It's nothing like seeing the Godfather on the big screen! It's as if you are right there in every scene! I would go to the movie theater today to see it one more time! That's the first time I'd sat that long to watch a movie! It was so worth it! Go to YouTube to see it!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mahmoodsecurity,10,28 November 2021,"Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),FollowArt,10,30 March 2024,"The Godfather,"" directed by the visionary Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, is a cinematic triumph that continues to astonish and inspire viewers across the globe. Its narrative, grounded in the dark, complex world of the mafia, is a brilliant exploration of power, loyalty, and the inevitable transformation wrought by violence and ambition."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mickeyhugehely,8,2 February 2012,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),giamelucafabien,10,24 January 2020,"This Movie is a work of art that is both past and contemporary.
A family story. A tragic story.
A piece of Italian American history.
Beautiful and timeless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pyrolola,10,25 July 2022,"The Godfather is a timeless Dime that isn't afraid of slow pacing storytelling or trying something new (1972). Thoughtful Camera work and an epic tale leave many including myself glued to the screen as every scene is articulated in such a way that screams perfection. Casting Crew hit the goldmine with this one as Brando, Pacino, and James Caan Should be an illegal combination. No more should be said except perfection."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ugefilms-554-606382,10,11 August 2020,"Marvelous, no words.
The director, the cinematography were perfect.
The best film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),onlinenotonline,8,24 March 2016,"The story of this film peeling from the life side of the area Corleone mafia family, a location in Sicily, Italy. Worked with a very neat, solid storyline, the acting of great stars of the very characteristic makes the movie The Godfather became a box office of all time. Proved in the world movie database site IMDb, the film which has 3 sequel ranks 2nd as the top rated movie under the movie Shawshank Redemption. The Godfather is a portrait of a Mafia family in New York, played with remarkable by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. If you ever watch this movie, I'm sure you'll agree with my review on these two Hollywood stars. Marlon Brando played Don Vito and Al-Pacino acted as his son named Michael. If not careful, the character of the role of these two men might impart life to the character of the audience. I am not making this up, after the film was released and success in the market, appears similar genre films in Hollywood which explores the life of mafia."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),KingCritic,10,25 February 2016,"So if you asked me what was one of the best films of all time, guess what I would say? The Godfather! My experience with the godfather began all the way back when I was a little kid. I would watch scenes of this movie all the way from 9 years ago. The main reason I love this film, is because it managed to get a book with uncountable sub plots, and turn it into a film with only one plot, Michael's. The way the movie follows Michael, and shows his subtle change through ingenious imagery, and slow but interesting dialogue, into by the end of the film, the big man himself.And its not like Michael hogs the movie or anything, he allows space for Sonny and Vito to grow in, and even for minor characters to give outstanding jobs acting. Another thing, the acting. Oh my god, the acting in this film is phenomenally amazing! It shows you that you can get a bit of the character, dig a hole in it, pour a bit of yourself in to it, and you have yourself a great character, with you playing as it. God! What performances. Brando's performance as Vito, is a textbook case of too good an actor-itis. Not only does the film manage to get something classical like dialogue from the book, and add its own unique style of being calm, but yelling through the words you are saying. Also, the dialogue from this movie, is something so ahead of its time, -Sigh-it's so good. There is no real legitimate criticism I can give The Godfather, besides the fact that it took some sub plots and characters I loved from the book, and chopped them out of the film for a faster run time, which is fine, since the movie is like 4 hours long. I can't tell you much more about the film without giving it away, which would be really messed up as it is a must watch film. It's good. It's the pinnacle of cinema. The zenith of movies. Just watch it it's so great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jamie-27252,10,15 July 2018,"This film was incredible. Unlike Goodfellas which was a juvenile and silly glorification of mobsters, Godfather was written to perfection and a masterpiece cinematically."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),onaykodu,10,22 November 2022,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Meshari_Aljuaid,9,7 November 2021,"A very exciting drama with a very interesting story, wonderful acting and wonderful special effects that embody the meanings of pain, love, care, the meaning of (the end) for every human being in this world and his written destiny for him."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benjamincepeda,10,15 October 2020,"First time I saw it, I didn't think it was the best film ever, but this second time... I don't know.
Marlon Brando I love you. With my life. Vito Corleone is my favorite character ever (with Forrest Gump), Marlon Brando makes the character unique, perfect.
Al Pacino, I love you. With my life. I can be like this with every actor in this film, because the actors are the best part. The script? Perfect. The director? Perfect, Coppola is so good. The music? Perfect. The actors? Perfect is short.
In my opinion, Forrest Gump and this one are the best films ever.
This is history. This is cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bda-levin,10,9 March 2007,"What more is there to say. The Godfather is the greatest film ever made. A 10 out of 10 rating just does not do it justice, there should be an 11 rating reserved just for films like this. The storyline is gripping from start to finish. The acting in this film is beyond brilliant, and there are so many classic scenes. In short it is more than a must see film. It is a fantastic synthesis of the cruel mafia underworld, and the story of the noble family behind it. What would I say to someone thinking of watching this? If you could only watch one other film before you die, then you would have to chose this one.It is the Perfect Movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),averyvolpe,10,5 May 2020,This movie was a masterpiece. Every scene is a piece of history. Coppola had put so much work on this and it is still today the best movie ever

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),theodoredeschris,10,30 December 2019,Hello there ...
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jsele-38952,10,26 April 2017,"This movie is widely considered in the community of film critics to be a landmark in motion picture history and is rightfully so ranked up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca as one the best movies in history. The lines are iconic, the scenes of family, betrayal and violence are all memorable, the performances are beyond Oscar worthy and it does what any great adaptation does; stay as faithful to the original as possible and only make changes whenever necessary. For me the most iconic scene is the baptism murders, which I felt are appropriately edited as Michael Corleone oversees the baptism of his infant son. The only minor nitpick I have is that, although Marlon Brando does give a solid performance, the look they gave him is a little too much like a geezer for me to believe he is a Mafia don. Nonetheless, this is a film that anyone taking a cinema class should watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cipistefan,10,18 September 2018,"Probably there is no one who has not seen him. The masterpiece, after ten eyes, is not boring."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Agent_67,10,18 March 2022,"Not as I expected, this movie showed me one of the greatest actors I've ever seen such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, etc.. but I didn't see that the story is great. Also, there was a problem with the time in this movie, you have to watch the first 18 minutes of the wedding scene which was so boring to be completely honest. Also, the story didn't show me the past of Vito Corleone, which I saw in The Godfather: Part II. The event of this movie was so slow and the story in some scenes becomes boring and not understandable. So, I give this Masterpiece (What people call it) 6.5 to 7 stars out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ujjwalkakade09,10,11 May 2023,"""The Godfather"" (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is an undeniable masterpiece that stands the test of time. Set in the world of organized crime, this iconic film paints a compelling portrait of the Corleone family's rise and fall. Marlon Brando's mesmerizing performance as the powerful and enigmatic Don Vito Corleone anchors the narrative, while Al Pacino shines as his conflicted son, Michael. With its richly textured storytelling, impeccable cinematography, and a script that delves deep into themes of loyalty, family, and the corrupting nature of power, ""The Godfather"" captivates audiences from start to finish. Coppola's masterful direction and the stellar ensemble cast bring the characters and their intricate relationships to life, leaving an indelible mark on cinema history. A timeless classic that combines gripping drama, intense performances, and unforgettable dialogue, ""The Godfather"" remains an essential viewing experience for all film enthusiasts."

Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece.worthy of preservation by the National Film Registry, and won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay.
This film has a large, brilliant cast of actors, most notably Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and James Caan, who arguably gave the most memorable performances of their careers.

I'll never forget this movie for many reasons, 3 already stated above and also the last reason is because its portrayal of mafia underworld couldn't be any nearer to the truth. I'll never get tired of watching it. The casting is perfect as no other actor could probably portray these characters better. This is due to the number of auditions and the right choice made by Francis Ford Coppola. The music is so perfect for this movie that it just draws you in."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hanalannister,8,11 January 2022,"Stereotypes have got to start somewhere. This is the birth of the modern gangster movie, so I'd expect the character types to be emulated by later films in the genre."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Owen-Jones-author,10,4 July 2018,"I once lived in a house with a gym and the others rented all the Godfather videos and played them back to back continuously forom Friday to Monday allowing anyone to come in and watch them.
The room was full all weekend and I didn't go out for four days... and you know what? I'd do it again like a shot!
I love the whole Godfather series.
Full marks."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RonMeyer77,10,30 January 2020,This is one of the best movies ever made. I've seen this and Godfather 2 over a dozen times! It's a timeless and perfect movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),avinashandyou,9,23 February 2020,"Amazing movie, such an inspiring movie for film professionals and film makers, there is a lot we can learn with the film, the directors view is the best part of the film,"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alexanderliljefors,8,7 April 2024,"Ive heard and read so many times that ""The Godfather"" is a must-watch classic, with a very large impact and reputation. And a very high rating on imdb. Aswell as it is one of the best films ever made. So i finally was able to give it a well deserved watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),andhisetyahermawan,10,19 July 2023,"In my opinion, Andhi Setya Hermawan gave an overall review, ""The Godfather"" is one of the most famous films and is considered one of the best films of all time. This film was released in 1972 and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, this film depicts the story of the powerful Italian-American mafia family, the Corleone family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samuraidesign,10,8 October 2016,"It is always difficult to talk about classic and no doubt ""The Godfather"" is a classic, in fact, one of the greatest of all time. The film has a charm part, which are the details behind the scenes, over all star cast, the author of the script and clear about the director and screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola who is a legend! No doubt the best of the film is the direction, which is an exquisite class! With an absurd Coppola will calm counting frame by frame this story that could have been done in a hurry the basis of chases and shootouts endless. But on the contrary, with few action scenes, the director uses all his talent to focus on very rich scenes with good use of light, sound, photography, performances and spectacular dialogues, all working in harmony and building this history that is intertwined with the dirt permeating the mafia and at the same time love and loyalty that is due to the family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),swapnilonline,10,23 August 2022,"This is one of the most valuable pieces of content available for creators to learn storytelling. Featuring a superb plot, screenplay, and dialogue, the movie delivers 100% entertainment to viewers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),g-96059,10,19 March 2020,"The growth and death of a man, the rise and fall of a family. Brotherly love, father and son love, rational and emotional love, friendship, men face the sacrifice and responsibility of family, career, love, the opposition and unity of justice and evil, is interpreted in the film. Countless classic lines, many unforgettable plots.It is also a very classic movie so far."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cshelton-86906,10,3 November 2019,"The Godfather is probably the greatest movie of all time.
The story, acting, script etc are masterfully crafted and executed, no other film can rival this piece of cinematic masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),secrethand,10,11 November 2019,"That was amazing movie i have ever seen! It has been a long time but I can tell one thing; This movie is a fantastic cult project in the world. And I can surely say more but enough. If you think you're unlucky of one in the world, take a look this lesson(The Godfather)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Critic563,10,10 June 2015,"The Godfather is generally considered one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion this stands, however it is nowhere near perfect. Most of the acting is very good, such as Marlon Brando's and Robert Duvall's performances, however Al Pacino's and Diane Keaton's performances are lacking. Talia Shire and James Caan give good performances, but not as remarkable as Brando's. The atmosphere of the movie is aided by the darkness in some of the settings, particularly those of the house. The film, on the other hand, is slightly too long . Some of the scenes could have been cut, and some sequences shortened, and the result would have been better. All in all this is a spectacular movie, which I urge you to see, but it is somewhat flawed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),raoul1179,8,11 June 2002,"I finally got around to seeing this movie.  I highly recommend it for reasons I'm sure the many other reviewers have already voiced.  In particular, Marlon Brando gives one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),VITALYI_KARYAKIN,10,19 June 2021,I constantly review it. Great acting. Excellent direction.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),finalsuccess_6608,9,12 October 2014,"The Godfather is the Godfather of movies too. Many may like it others may not perhaps understand it for the first time they watch it. They need to re-watch perhaps. Anyways, This movie is intense in acting, severe in direction and watchable in any point of time. Even after 4 decades, the movie maintains its slot in first 5 of IMDb top 250. The opening line:""I believe in America"" to the very end keeps you entertaining SLOWLY and STEADILY. For those who understand mafia, underworlds and gaming zones of elites, they can understand this movie. Marlon Brando is supreme as DON. The duologue's are perfect and the cinematography is plausible."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sjlesko,8,23 December 2017,"This almost flawless piece of art follows the Corleone family through their involvement in the mafia. It perfectly depicts both the business and family sides of life in the mafia. The only downside to the film is, that for someone not engaged in the history and depth of the story that is being told, it may come across as boring."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SpiralWire,8,4 April 2005,"Derirative, contrived, moronic in parts, inexcusably slapstick, horrendously acted, monstrously ill-informed, soul-wastingly aimless, incompetantly structured, amazingly awful dialogue, virulently hideous casting, monstrous over use of toilet humour, inescapably stupid bodily function gags, insanely complicated plot, innumerable plot-holes, a myriad of anachronisms, baffling directorial ineptitude, spectacularly pretentious and alienating, superbly bad costumes, terrible make-up, manically dire soundtrack... "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),altunkenway,10,30 March 2020,"I watched this movie about a year ago, since then I can't get this movie out of my head. The story is very well done and in the middle of the movie the story just sinks you in so you literally can't take your eyes off the movie. When I watched the movie for the first time I was still looking at the screen despite the movie being over, and I was almost paralyzed in my seat. My brother even had to shut the movie down for me, I even had trouble walking."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),p-35646,10,6 April 2020,"The movie has a smooth plot, a story of gang fighting, and how the old godfather abdicated and how mike became the new godfather.
In the actor acting marlon brando the old godfather interpretation of the unsurpassable, deep eyes, deep voice, elegant movements. A textbook performance, no doubt."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ismath_m,10,23 July 2013,"This is my first review. It is an excellent and very well done movie There can be no mistake. When you watch The Godfather, you know you are watching something special. Pherhaps, the best film of all time, and surely in my top 5. great cast, great plot, and the magic of Coppola, love it. The mafia is seen like never before in a film, and now, no one can make such a cinematographic masterpiece as the godfather. The Godfather has been showered with praise by nearly all major critics out there. This is one of my all time favorite. This movie stands at the top in all decades. ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.""There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Lily_hoho,9,16 March 2020,"I had nothing to do on Sundays, and I found the godfather to pass the time.
And then still marveled. If it's true that there's one of the greatest movie openings of all time, this is the one.
Epic films like the godfather, with their huge story structure, their complicated relationships, and their many plot points, all need to be built up in the first act to lay a solid foundation for the rest of the narrative; In this limited time in the pursuit of infinite space, I think, as long as the relevant content can be put in all not bloated, is quite a realm; Can also be in a paragraph, comb the vein clear, simple and complex, only the great master can do.
Why did coppola keep so many relevant details in his hands?
After all, I thought he was telling a story.
To tell a story, to get rid of unnecessary technology, to tell a story in a down-to-earth way,
This kind of unpretentious, should also be one of the temperament that the epic pursues."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mamantillam,10,5 October 2023,"I was not a huge fan of old movies until I saw The Godfather. Before I saw it, I used to think that old movies were boring, and if it lasted more than 2 hours it would be even more. But then I decided to give it a chance, and now I consider myself kind of a fan of this trilogy. It talks about the story of Michael Corleone, who was the son of Vito Corleone, a respected leader of the Italian mafia in America and played a central role in the story. Most people think that it is just a mafia story, some even think that it focuses on drugs, but it really goes beyond just that, it is a story that shows us the development of Michael, a character who from the beginning seems to be in total disagreement with the family business, but the love he has for his father and the respect for him, transform him into the perfect successor, willing to change his principles in order to support his father and his family, since these are his main pillars."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gokulbaskaran07,10,15 September 2018,"A True Master pieces from Francis Ford Coppola, and both Al Pacino and Marlon Brando were at their best in acting. Dialogue Delivery is very awesome, one can watch this movie n number of times and never get bored."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),questl-18592,8,27 February 2020,"Big shout out to Flashback Cinemas for helping me finally, FINALLY, get this off my list of shame."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),slipknotsuck,10,8 October 2005,"The godfather is cinema at its very best intriguing suspenseful and provoking, Francis ford Coppola manages to create a modern myth in the space of the course of the film surrounding the corleone family the main protagonist of the movie. The ageing don corleonie played eloquently by the late Marlon Brando refuses to enter into the narcotics trade following the end of ww2, following don Vito refusal this starts off a gang war between the 5 families of new york with the corleonies. The antagonist the barzini family and the tattalia family attemp to have don Vito character killed effectively castrating the corleones power. The attempt fails and Sonnie the dons eldest son takes control of the family while don Vito recovers meanwhile the dons youngest son Michael played by AL pacino agrees to kill the tattalia top narcotics distributor in a carefully orchestrated subterfuge at a peace negotiation. The death of the narcotic distributor escalates the war further leading to sonnies bloody execution at a toll booth one of the movies memorable scenes. Young Michael while in exile in Italy learns of his brothers misfortune and takes over following his fathers retirement, he vows revenge for his brothers murder. I will not give to much of the plot away but it is intriguing to see all the scheming and plotting by the mobsters. Both the camera work and lighting are superb and give a real atmospheric feel to the picture. This film is a must see for all film fans, rent it buy it now."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),keb0bul3,10,10 December 2023,"The Godfather is an American epic crime film, The Godfather is as much about America, and the American experience, as any other great movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cosmonadz,10,21 January 2020,This is the perfect example of how to transform a story from book to script to screen. No derail spared no character left unexplored and no thread of story left unanswered. All the cast performed magically and this is one of them rare occasions when a movie literally outdoes any review. Brando Pacino Duvall Caan all deliver performances of a life time and bring to the screen one of the most powerful portrayals of how the mob is a family and that family is Corleone.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mr. Film,10,17 May 1999,"""The Godfather"" is a masterful film, rich in every component essential to it's development.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),info-93850,10,26 May 2023,"Le Parrain is simply one of my all-time favorite films. I was completely captivated by this epic saga from the very first time I watched it. Every time I revisit it, I am immersed in the dark and fascinating world of the Italian-American mafia."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LeThAlWeApOn389,10,15 June 2003,The best movie of all time. Unforgettable catch phrases. Unforgettable role playing. Simply unforgettable. Marlon Brando is the all-time greatest godfather who ever was. Al Pacino's first big hit movie is a triumph. I loved the movie because of decision making and full of frustration and suspense. Excellent.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),davidgaston-17594,10,21 June 2019,"You simply can't go wrong when you put together great actor such as Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and combine them with a great director like F.F.C.
Outstanding performances, correct directing and very good story. Not the greatest of all time but sure it is in my top 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MaggieJohnson98,10,17 April 2017,"I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites. The actors gave these characters special meanings and helped to make the ""criminals"" more ""likable"" in my opinion. This movie is one of my ""go to"" choices when I am looking for something more familiar to watch and I honestly can view it every view days with no problem. If you are looking for a ""mafia"" movie that also spends time showing some of the family connections, than this movie is for you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sauhardchaurasiya,8,1 October 2023,"Though staring a little slow, the movie was simply amazing. I sure wasn't any specific moment in the movie where I got excited except for the end. Anyways, the acting was a little too good to be true... the dialogues, the character developments all so good that modern cinema cant even touch it. One thing that stood most out of this movie was it's soundtrack, simply amazing. Cinematography and color designs of this movie are so damn good that we can see it even today - showing the color orange or even real oranges when a character is gonna die holds us the the entire movie, a true genius choice. The last scene of this movie where we see a character closing door on Michael's wife's face shows how he is getting disconnected from the family and when when Michael gets called ""Don"" seriously gave me goosebumps. I liked the movie good but i think that i am born in the wrong generation and in wrong time to truly feel what a beauty it is."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Yassinemarchoud,10,14 March 2022,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mariananporto,10,29 December 2020,"I did not have high expectations before watching the movie cause I thought it may be overrated. I could not be more wrong about this initial thought. Probably the best most incredibly done mafia movie I have ever watched. After watching some of Scorsese's best mafia movies I thought I had already met cinematic excellence, but ""The Godfather"" overcomes that. Al pacino and Brando's acting is good enough to make any cinema lover whip a tear. Definitely a must see film."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Polonius85,10,17 February 2012,"The Godfather is one of those movies that could be considered perfect or near perfect. It's a perfect ten in just about every category of what makes a great film: Cinematography, story, character development, action sequences, acting, plot twists...this movie is an absolute masterpiece. There's no clichés or corny moments, no annoying, useless characters, and its about as original as it comes in all aspects of story. The Corleone family is both evil and moral, both sympathetic and begging for hatred, both understandable and from another world. Vito Corleone is a ruthless crime boss, but at the same time, has standards and a sense of right and wrong. Michael Corleone goes from being a war hero who claims that he is not his family, to a mafia don more ruthless than his father. Sonny, his older brother, is a loose cannon, but with method to his madness. Every time I watch this movie, I ask myself: How did Coppola and Puzo do it? How can this movie be described as anything except perfect? If I have ANY gripe with The Godfather, at the toll booth, there's no way that somebody could take that many rounds and still not be incapacitated. Yeah, people don't always drop with one round in real life, but fifteen guys opening up on full auto with .45 ACP rounds from a Tommy Gun is going to kill pretty damn quickly! But I'm a gun nut, so that's a nit pick. That, I guess knocks the Godfather down to about a 9.999999999999999999 out of 10!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),traedprice,9,10 April 2020,"What can you say? Its a flawless film. This here is a pinnacle of crime films the cinematic lighting.

I really enjoyed the film and I really hope they do a remake for the film because it's totally worth it.Also,the other two parts of the Godfather sequel are as great as the first part.Moreover, Francess Ford Copolla is one of the most amazing directors I have ever seen in my life, he is the right man for the right job. Francess Ford Coppola brought to us one of the most classic movies that will be in our heart forever.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GillianoTheCreative,10,6 February 2017,"Lets talks about the godfather. Now i know what everyone is thinking, 27 nominations and 23 was won. Very accomplished movie to say the least but that's not what makes it a great movie. What makes it a great movie is that it is timeless! It exceeds every expectation that was brought upon it. Now i know about 90 percent of IMDb users will say "" of course it's a great, what is there not to like about it. Well this movie does have a few flaws, not a lot but a few! But overall a fantastic piece of art. I've always wanted to create a movie that was visual as much as the godfather was or is. It really jumped Hollywood into a new era where mob movies were a thing and you could totally take risk with your story development and other things as well. I think it's fair to say that this movie has probably inspired a lot of directors in the film industry or better known as ""Hollywood"". I'm not a screen writer so don't get on me to bad for my spelling at times in this review."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yashariranikhah,9,25 September 2019,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),karaservicemancom,9,16 January 2024,"The Godfather movie was a beautiful Yasar movie. Although this movie is an old movie, it has a very interesting scenario. Every part of this movie is better than the previous part."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jacobbriscombe,10,1 March 2022,"What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned from people countless times? This film is so beautifully woven and is a perfect example of a flawless film. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't experience this holy grail. I watched it for the first time in cinema due to the 50th anniversary release and was completely subdued in the story the 3 hour runtime went by so fast. Some people say that slow pacing is a drawback but for this film it's the total opposite. The pacing just really lets the audience feel apart of this family and like you are actually there on the dark paths that ensue my favourite example being the end shot of the door closing shutting out Kay and us, leaving you with a feeling of awe, intrigue and frustration as you want to see more of this world Coppola throws you in."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rtmcxnmbh,10,22 January 2023,This Movie was an absolute masterpiece. After wathing The Godfather you become a man. This movie is excellent.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pulpficat,8,5 September 2023,"Once upon a time, in the suburbs of the Big Apple, there was a man named Vito Corleone who made his fortune selling olive oil. The Corleone family's olive oil business was top-notch, thanks to a combination of quality products and a unique customer appreciation campaign that included complimentary silencers and silk ties. With such marketing genius, it's no wonder they became the envy of their rivals."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),y-33180,9,16 May 2020,"The godfather tells a romantic gangster epic in a melancholy and calm style. It is one of the greatest gangster movies in the history of the film and is known as the bible of men. Not only has the film been successful in criticism, art and box office, but it has also set an example for future generations. It is a classic film praised by many people, and it has a good rating of up to 100 percent on authoritative film websites. The American Film Academy, an authoritative film organization in the United States, appraised it as ""the greatest gangster classic film in the United States"" and ""godfather"" has a profound influence on film history, gangster type films and popular culture. It is the best film in the film history in the hearts of many directors. The excellent interpretation of actors such as Malone Brando, Alpacio, Robert de Niro and so on, coupled with the historical poetical nature of the story itself, makes the film a masterpiece. ""godfather"", as a gangster film, is not nihilism to dilute the meaning of religion, on the contrary, this film has a deep Christian brand, it rarely discusses good and evil, and rarely uses subjective lens to express religious morality, but at several nodes, it focuses on the inner suffering of the characters and lightly expresses this connotation."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thnationu,10,23 July 2022,"I saw this movie when i was studying in a university, reaaly this is so impressive , that a child reached in USA and became the head of mafia and criminal, he prove him self as a godfather he was involve in every field of life especially politics."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lih-04387,9,11 June 2024,"Vito Kliman: As an old generation godfather, Vito is the leader of the family and plays a vital role in the growth of everyone. In the opening study, he easily helps the Italian civilians around him solve problems. He teaches his godson Johnny to value his family and face problems like a man. He teaches Sonny to care more about his family and not to show his family's thoughts. He teaches Fred to participate more in family affairs. He has strong ability to solve problems and looks at the world with a long-term perspective. Although Vito is engaged in the gang industry, he still maintains his conscience and never participates in drugs. He clearly understands that if he participates in drug trafficking, all the forces behind him will draw a line with him. When Mike was in exile and Sonny was assassinated, he chose to meet with the heads of the five major families, giving up some of his interests in exchange for the other party's retaliation, and at the same time let Mike return to the country to take charge of the overall situation. This was the best solution at the time, retreating to advance and preserving the strength of the family. After that, the seriously injured old godfather Vito began to go behind the scenes and handed over the family business to Mike."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stepanovaeva,10,19 January 2022,"The Godfather... This film is not so much about bandits, but about the life and broken destinies of people. The film is entirely filled with some drama and experiences of all the main characters!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Onlyindreams17,10,5 October 2001,"The Godfather is great. For almost thirty years now audiences have been captivated and intrigued by the Corleone family. And no other mafia movie has ever come as close to being this good. The story is just amazing and the directing by Francis Ford Coppola is nothing less than spectacular. Coppola has taken the concept of organized crime in America, something that was once looked down upon, and has built a cult following around it, with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as their leading figures. And I don't think any single film has produced as many memorable scenes as The Godfather. Who could ever forget Marlon Brando, as Vito Corleone, buying those oranges on that fateful day? Or James Caan, as Sonny Corleone, getting massacred by the barrage of machine-gun bullets? And lines that will forever be repeated by fans like, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" The bottom line is that The Godfather has changed the way we look and judge films. It has made cool what is sinful, crime a family value, and dynamic characters the modern-day icons of several generations of storytelling in film. Alongside all the revolutionary pictures of all time, The Godfather earns it place at the very top. Whether it is the #3 greatest film by the American Film Institute, #1 by IMDb, or #2 by me, this movie should very well be agreed by all to be a landmark in American film history."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kevin_dellinger,8,12 December 2017,This is by far one if not the greatest movie ever.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),magictaco-40201,10,27 December 2018,Wonderful story!!!! I think that older movies have better stories and personally this is one of the greatest stories of all time.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Holt344,10,19 August 2021,"The Godfather is directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo and it's based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. Why is this film regarded as a classic and of course among of the best films in history? It's an three hour ride of cinema of some of the finest written, finest acted, finest cinematography, finest editing, the remarkable musical score by Nino Rota and of course the brilliance that is Francis Ford Coppola. He created a masterpiece but bear in mind, though it is a movie everyone should watch, the slow pace and long length might turn some people off but if you bear with the slow pace then you will absolutely love the film. For being released in 1972 it was a very violent film. It's also full of symbolism which makes a second or third viewing so much more fun as there's so many details the director placed into its many scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kiran-sh,10,31 March 2012,"Normally it is said that when read a book you do not like the movie but it is being proved wrong by Godfather. This movie goes exactly what you must have imagined while reading the book. This is the only movie that has every thing in it drama, thriller, romance and action actually you can say this is made for all type of audience in the world. There was so many characters whom i did not like while reading the book but i loved it while watching the movie i saw it to late but if you have not seen it yet then you must watch it this will not waste your time instead you will learn a lot. This movie is the perfect example of film making."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),steelcityindie,10,2 January 2024,I've watched this mutlple times a year since we've been able to pull up our favorite movies. Now as a screenwriter and currently working on my first film The Godfather has been one of the films that has taking my storytelling to another level. It has all the components to a perfect screenplay.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),qqq456,10,4 June 2008,"when I watched this move I thought it was boring but when the story unraveled it was one of my favorite movies.it is most certainly a perfect film If you have not seen it you almost have to. have to just for reference it comes on peach tree all the time. This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abdullx,10,12 June 2019,The Greatest Of All Time. I will never see a movie like The Godfather
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mojoboy,10,18 September 2000,"This is probably one of the finest films I've ever seen.  Truly it's a classical masterpiece of cinematography and really gripping plot.  This movie not only launched the careers of the actors, but also affirmed the heavyweights as well.  It beautifully portrays the value of family, with romance, politics, and certainly blatant war. Yet, the movie is almost poetic, with violent scenes that don't drench you in gore, and a language that isn't in your face.  Simply put, it's what every great action/drama film should be.  A must-see for every true film goer."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Craig_Steeley_Jr,10,19 July 2018,Greatest Movie of All Time! You have to see this movie before you die. You have to see this movie if you are starting out in the acting/directing industry.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),flopezgraziano,10,22 July 2020,"A classic of the cinema without a doubt. One of the best films of all time, and without a doubt one of the best films about the mafia ever made. An atmosphere and ambiance that makes you feel inside an Italian-American crime family, with unforgettable performances that have permeated popular culture."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),panovau,10,19 January 2022,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alienstranger,8,21 December 2023,"Frankly speaking,it took me multiple viewings in order to really appreciate this movie. But despite my best efforts i am giving it 8 out of 10. Its ending was just poetic and cant be described in words. Brando's character was very solid and manly. I have no personal liking for underworld movies. Probably this is the reason why i am unable to understand its 2nd position on IMDB list. I do believe its a great movie and a very coherent one but not that great i guess. Like shawshank i also think about this that this is an overrated movie and should not be that high on this list.i wont see this movie again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),femaleloveu5,10,9 October 2020,"This isn't fair a delightfully created hoodlum film. Or an exceptional family representation, for that matter. An astounding period piece. A character think about. A lesson in filmmaking and an motivation to eras of on-screen characters, chiefs, screenwriters and makers. For me, this can be more: this can be the authoritative film. 10 stars out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sammyheins,10,16 June 2018,"Great movie, Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally persued when he refuses to sulley the family business with drugs.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Tommydevito,10,16 March 2003,"There isn't anything more to say about the Godfather that hasn't already been said. Words simply cannot describe fully how good this movie is.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ezehdarlington,10,9 February 2023,"""The Godfather"" (1972) is a timeless classic that has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is a masterful epic that explores the inner workings of a powerful Mafia family in New York City. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo and follows the aging patriarch of the Corleone family, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), as he tries to maintain his power and protect his family from the various threats that come their way."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Craig_Steeley_Jr,10,19 July 2018,"If you ever had to choose a movie for any positive reason whatsoever, choose this movie. This movie is something that is a guaranteed must see before you die. One of the GOATs."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),spinellione-44192,10,23 December 2019,"This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),taheriitaheriiarian,10,25 May 2021,This movie is a complete masterpiece followed by amazing actors that did a very well job.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),apinborya,10,25 April 2023,"I recently had the pleasure of re-watching the timeless classic, ""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo. This masterpiece, released in 1972, tells the gripping story of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American Mafia clan, and their struggle to maintain power amidst rivalries and crime."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),DemonKiki,10,9 April 2020,"As a classic film, ""The Godfather"" is perfect in storytelling, performance, photography, and movie skills, and can be used as a textbook for movies. As an epic film, the whole story has a huge pattern, a complicated plot, and many characters. There are more than 20 characters who need to be expressed, but the film handles them in an orderly manner. Under Coppola's superb director skills, the characters are distinct in primary and secondary, and the character is full. Some characters only need one lens and one detail to express the character's character."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),scorpiosunil-81912,10,17 August 2021,"It is an absolutely a action packed blockbuster movie. What a movie by ford, evergreen blockbuster movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Rock-The-World,9,16 December 2023,"The Godfather is a must watch. The acting is outstanding, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. This a film where all actors are in rare form in an ensemble cast, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Al Pacino did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GregorioSalcedo,9,14 December 2018,This movie is a timeless classic. Very interesting facts about the taping of the film as well.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stefanbe,10,5 July 2007,"When somebody approaches a screening of The Godfather, there is naturally going to be a bit of nervousness approaching it, since so many people have called one of the greatest films of all-time. There is a feeling that he will come away with comments like ""It wasn't that great."" or ""That's supposed to be brilliant masterpiece."" Well, I am going to add some more into the hype machine, because the many other raves about The Godfather are true. It is a phenomenal motion picture that deserves its awards, praise and even more. Francis Ford Coppola constructed one of the shining works of the New Hollywood Era and due to the many spoofs that people produce, both in films, television and YouTube, it has stayed in the memories of countless film lovers. Much like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, a viewing of The Godfather is a must for any film aficionado."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),XXX-STREAMS,10,19 March 2024,"Just finished watching The Godfather, and let me tell you, it's an absolute masterpiece! Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is a journey into the heart of the mafia underworld, filled with intrigue, power struggles, and unforgettable characters. I can't wait to share my thoughts on this iconic piece of cinema."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),faz-gdl5,10,27 September 2022,"The work changes the audience's perception of crime movies, especially the gangster series. Before that, the term ""mafia"" was unfamiliar to Hollywood. Crime themes often revolve around murders and detective investigations that end with evil being brought to light. From 1930 to 1968, Will Hays - the late president of the MPAA (American Motion Picture Association) - applied Hays law, requiring movies not to depict in detail criminal acts such as murder, theft, robbery, etc. The director must not tell a crime story with a point of view that empathizes with or inspires imitations."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JuanManuelPinto,10,4 May 2020,"I've watch thiis movie over a hundred times at least, and still it captures me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),verydistinguished,10,1 August 2005,"I have watched it more than six times and every time I watch it I discover that it is more beautiful than before. Every aspect of this movie is really wonderful. I can say it is one of the masterpieces in the history of film making. To me it is the number one movie of all times. Marlon Brando was marvelous. Al Pacino was adorable. James Caan was great. Robert Duval was really great. It is really hard to tell what is missing in this movie. The whole package was really astonishing. I have never imagined a movie will have such an impact on me as well as on many others. I have watched it with my brothers a couple of years ago. You won't believe it if I tell you that every year I go to a movie store and rent it again. I will be doing this for the rest of my life because it is an artistic piece that is worth watching more and more. In conclusion, I would like to say that if Marlon Brando had not been there, this movie would have lost a lot of its glimmering and shimmering light. Al Pacino was also as outstanding as Marlon Brando. The movie is a way beyond criticism. It is a work of art for all generations and at all times. Also the story itself is well-knit that you feel it happened in reality. There are lots of movies out there, but they never measure up to the God Fahter."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ajay-92672,10,12 September 2017,"Heard a lot about this movie but i was not interested in watching this movie since it is a gangster movie and there would not be much of a story but then i watched the trilogy and was by blown away by the performances and the screenplay,this is truly the greatest gangster movie ever made,that is the reason it is still remembered even after 45 years and this has been adapted by various filmmakers"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dannyrovira-38154,10,13 January 2021,"Francis Ford Coppola's classic landmark crime epic is one of the finest most riveting American films ever made. It is based upon Mario Puzo's best selling novel of the same name. Set in 1945 on Long Island it tells the tale of the most powerful Mafia family dynasty in America, which is led by the aging Don Vito Corleone, sensationally played by the late great Marlon Brando, who made a phenomenal career comeback with this brilliant Oscar winning performance. His youngest son Michael, played marvelously by Al Pacino in his breakout Oscar nominated performance, has just returned from serving with the Marines in World War II, and is attending the wedding of his beloved sister Connie, played wonderfully by Talia Shire. The joyful family occasion is short lived because of a ruthless drug dealer named Virgil Sollozzo, impressively played by the late great character actor Al Lettieri, who is looking for financial support as well as protection from the Corleone family. But when Don Vito refuses and turns down Sollozzo's request, he tries to have Don Vito assassinated by two hit men who gun him down outside a fruit stand, but Don survives the hit barely. This will set in motion a series of deadly events into play and a full scale Mob war will begin. Magnificent direction by Coppola, with impeccable supporting performances by James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, and Abe Vigoda. Breathtakingly filmed with beautiful on location sequences shot in Sicily by the late great master cinematographer Gordon Willis, Nino Rota's unforgettable musical score is powerfully haunting. This is one of the few rare times where the film is better than the book. ""The Godfather"" is a history-making cinematic masterpiece that is the winner of three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor: Marlon Brando, and Screenplay: Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),guidocostante,9,13 November 2023,"The film reflects the reality it narrates down to the smallest details, especially in Brando's part.among other things, it clearly brings to life the mafia world of both the past and recent years. The cast is impressive and above all well assorted, the actors are well immersed in the part and express the characters of the characters played very well."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bogdanmateica,10,2 May 2017,"Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of European art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release. Nino Rota's score, the sumptuous set design, and Brando's raspy pseudo-whisper have become part of our collective cultural memory."

Sadly, this means some people will be disappointed. I've felt the same way about Dr. Strangelove and Back to the Future. So every movie has naysayers, just how it is. But I am always astoundes when I hear someone does not like The Godfather. 
It really is the closet thing to a perfect film that I have ever seen. From the story, the production, direction, and of course, the acting. Brando puts on his greatest performance. Pachino, Duvall, Keaton and Caan also put on extraordinary performances. The movie is long but never boring. It always manages to keep you interested even in the more slow parts. That is good filmmaking."

The GodFather is not a movie but more a pillar to understanding the human race. I am going to keep this review short and sweet.. Don't watch the GodFather, but embrace the jewels of life it offers and it will teach you life lessons beyond what you can imagine. <<<---This was what I wrote before IMDb prompted me that my review does not contain enough lines and I need at least 10 lines of text. I will take this opportunity to commend the perfect selection of the cast and crew. Usually, every movie I watch there is ALWAYS some sort of comment or critique I add within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The Godfather & Braveheart are the only two films that I have not had a critique for which still boggles me to this day. The Godfather is the only movie that I could watch over and over and will continue to watch over and over throughout my life, and not get bored even just a little to say the least.

This epic story will span over a trilogy from the turn of the century to the late 70s and centres in on Michael Corleone the unsuspecting heir to a legacy left vacant by Vito Corleone The Godfather. Enemies , friends , family , authorities , who can you trust in a cesspool of corruption , deceit , murder and politics , Michaels path is laid out for him and its obvious the apron strings cant be cut no matter his reluctance no matter his refusal , when it comes to family you need to take your place at the table especially this family. World class Script , Direction , and Acting , BRANDO , PACINO & DENIRO swim in these rolls as the heads of the Corleone crime family and a legacy is born with an untouched masterpiece...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

Still, it ain't as good as everybody makes it out to be. And can anybody justify casting Marlon Brando, James Caan, John Savage, and Robert Duvall as the brain-trust of an Italian mob family?

I remember that before i see this brilliant film, i had already seen one of its greatest scenes in the Simpson's's. Well, i would just like to say to the ones who haven't seen this movie yet, that this is definitely one of the movies that we must see before we die.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Arshia22,9,31 December 2021,This movie blows your mind away with its great cast. This movie is full of emotions and ups and downs. It depicts a father that has the will to do anything to keep his family safe and happy at any cost. It also shows how a man can be so cruel.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sandynolen,10,21 August 2021,"One of the best movies ever made! Best actors; great scenes, direction, location, production! We need more directors, actors, & producers like this to return to the US, operating on all cylinders! The story, although disturbing & bloody and vaguely based on true stories related to the mafia/cartel is so true to life."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kishan-25422,10,20 April 2021,The best movie of all time. It is the great beginning of the greatest film trilogy of all time. Truly mesmerizing with it's epic directing and stellar cast. It is definitely Hollywood (actually film-making as a whole) at its best. Loved the scenes and the atmosphere. It really deserves all the love it gets.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),netsez00,10,19 February 2017,"This is the movie that created the mobster genre. It took mob movies to an entirely new level of depth. Plot, dialogue, intrigue, all top notch to compliment the action. In addition the cast was legendary and all of them were at the top of their game. If you ever thought all mob movies are the same it is because they all copied The Godfather!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ontimeagency,9,27 January 2023,"One of the greatest movies of all times! I wish to give 1000 stars. Epic movie! I have always loved movies on mafia and underworld. This movie is the rarest diamond amongst all. Extremely interesting, enticing, thought provoking. What else can be the benchmark for a cinema industry! Oh my God. This movie cams you, makes you feel joy, makes you think of sensible uber class dealing with organized crime, way of handling situation like a game play, astounding personality representation, makes your heart pound faster, your pulse rate, sweat and relief. The way this movie presents the reason for existence of mafia world, the beginning of it, the balance, the fall everything just is so heart touching. Unbelievable. Thank you for giving us such wonderful movie experience. Its tremendous work done. This movie depicts the sincere work with lots of love. No one can bring out such an epic movie, even if paid a billion dollars each. I just get up everytime I hear Godfatherto watch time and again."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alahmed-55673,10,26 February 2020,I wanted to watch this movie for a long long time. almost 3 years the only thing that prevented me from watching it all these years is that a few friends of mine told me that everyone dies in the end. And I don't like this in movies.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hopkinshome-13772,10,11 February 2021,"I went into this movie with the mindset of this will be overrated. After watching, Goodfellas, The Departed, and The Irishman, I expected The Godfather would be the same. All I expected from it was to be the first best mob movie, which set the trend of all other mob movies. As I started watching it, I quickly realized it isn't like the other mob movies. It is better. It has more of a story and character development. The Godfather is one of the best mob movies ever, with an actual story and character development. The acting is impressive, and the story is even better. This is 100% a must-watch if you are into mob movies or classic movies."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rockybalboa2430,10,28 June 2005,"this is probably the best film in the history of cinema, if not the best, then at least in the top 5. a film can be good for one of many reasons; good acting, good direction, writing, etc., good entertainment (simply fun to watch) or a brilliant artistic piece of work. the godfather contains all of these elements. the cast alone is a given that the acting will be brilliant, and as the cast suggests, it is. Brando reinvented himself, Pacino's screen legend was born and Duval and Caan are simply wonderful. the women are notable as well, Talia Shire and Diane Keaton. many others shine in smaller roles."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),icarax750,10,1 May 2023,"As my title suggests, I believe the Godfather and specifically the first part is arguably the most complete movie in the top 250 in that all its elements are of high quality - the story, the characters, the presentation techniques such as lighting. It is masterfully adapted from a definitely well-written novel and it's obvious that the movie producers also followed and emphasised the themes the writer focused on appropiately."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dynat,10,24 April 2005,"The Godfather show us that a good movie remains forever a good movie. We should see all the little parts and all the sub-meanings that this movie brings. The cast is exceptional and Marlon Brando (may God have mercy of his soul) plays in a way that words can't describe it. Just watch the movie and enjoy it. It's the best movie ever! The Godfather II and III were only good, not exceptional like the first part. This is a once in a lifetime movie and it must be understood. I've read all sorts of articles and declarations of the actors, i know all the story of making the movie and that information, beside watching the movie convinced me that The Godfather will remain one of the best movies of the history. It should get more Oscars."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),prolevg,9,19 January 2022,"I saw it very late. Interest was one of the main reasons. The theme is the second reason. For many friends to see it was a real experience. And this is a real experience. After all, in a movie about the mafia, for a special viewer, at first glance, everything is perfect. So perfect that scene after scene becomes something more than a masterpiece. Great actors, special shows. Memorable scenes. Dialogues of the situation and the feeling of cold. Valuable films.

The Corleone family, headed by the aging Vito Corleone, is the most powerful family on the East coast, and possibly all of America. They ""own"" senators, judges and policemen. They are above the law. Vito's son, Michael, has just returned from the war a hero, and wants no part in the family business. But when an up and coming rival family wanting to get into the drug trade asks the Corleones for protection, Don Vito declines their offer, sticking to his traditional Sicilian values. The other families aren't as concerned about the old ways and want in, but know that they can't do business without the Corleones' influence. So, they have Don Corleone shot, expecting to gain leverage with the Don out of action. Luckily, the Don survives and Michael, furious with the attempt on his father's life, steps up to take out the opposition."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rhaldbenitez,10,18 February 2023,"The Godfather is a movie that has truly earned its place in cinematic history. The film is an expertly crafted exploration of the world of organized crime, showcasing the gritty realities of this violent and dangerous world while also delving into the complex relationships between the characters. The acting is top-notch, with Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's portrayal of Michael Corleone being particularly memorable. The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the story and the characters. The music, cinematography, and direction are all masterful, making ""The Godfather"" a movie that is both emotionally intense and intellectually stimulating. In my opinion, this is a film that every cinema lover should experience at least once in their lifetime."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vanclucian,10,29 October 2017,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out.. With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day.."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sjoshi64,10,5 January 2003,"I honestly think this is the finest piece of cinema I have every viewed (but then again, I can't claim to have seen vast quantities of movies). Firstly, the aesthetics mark it out as a classic: some shots, such as those of Vito Corleone in his study, could be removed from the film and considered art by themselves. Not only are the costumes beautiful, the lighting, sets and movement makes the film absolutely stunning, visually. All scenes appear to have a mild sepia tint and the lights particularly focus our eyes on peoples' expressions."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),chubid,10,13 December 2020,"A perfect movie. Perfectly cast, beautifully shot, great acting from everyone involved, the development of each character is fascinating to watch and just watching Al Pacino and Brando give a masterclass in acting is delightful."

At times, it was promising a utopian future, where scientific inventions and developments will make life so much better for ""humans"", and machines (robots or, more generally, artificial intelligence) will be doing all the hard work.

You have Michael swearing to renounce Satan in the church while his minions are slaughtering men on the street, under his orders."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),parachute-4,9,30 October 2006,"The key to the success of this defining gangster movie is the faultless casting. All the characters are strong and eminently believable. The central masterpiece is, of course, Brando's Don Corleone, a feudal mafia warlord of the old school who can distribute largess or initiate mayhem with no more than a mumbled whisper to his ever-attentive mobster acolytes. Excellent performances from Al Pacino , James Caan, and Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden as the tough, bad cop and one of my favorite screen thugs, Al Lettieri as ""The Turk"" Solozzo. A fairly predictable plot, even if you haven't first read the book , but so what? Its not meant to be a mystery. We the audience KNOW that the enemies of the family are going to get what's coming to them by way of the usual methods, and the director does not disappoint us. The traditional christening juxtaposed with the scenes of vengeful carnage are a masterful touch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dhughbnks,10,17 August 2019,"This movie balances humanity, drama, and classic mafia violence in spades. The death of Sonny stands out as one of the most iconic moments from the movie with graphic violence and zero restraint. The Godfather also deals with the struggle of a man who tries to do good but has to deal with the pressure of his family. This movie balances the style of a gangster movie with the substance of a carefully crafted story."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),liamoconnor,10,28 August 2004,"GQ Magazine once had a cover story saying ""why can't more women look like Gyeneth Paltrow"". I say why can't more film's be like The Godfather. The film that revatalised Marlon Brando's career and set Al Pacino and Robert Duvall on two of the most successful film career's ever.In terms of atmosphere it has yielded on of the greatest scenes in cinematic and atmospheric history. I am of course referring to the scene in Lou's Diner (which was, sadly, recentely torn down). Channel 4 (UK) ran a poll of the ""100 greatest movies ever"". The Godfather was second to some film about Mark Hamill and a beam sword. In my clearly unbiassed opinion The Best Film Ever"

You are immediately immersed in Don Corleone's world. It's beautiful to watch this film build anticipation through engaging discussions between characters and not a bunch of action. This builds excitement that climaxes in the restaurant murder scene. The cinematography is incredible. You feel a part of the scene. Several characters are defined and developed throughout the film. One of the best movies of all time."

It's hard to say something that hasn't already been said and it's even harder to explain why this movie is just so perfect.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fahatis,9,7 December 2021,"The scale of achievement is such that it not only defined the image of gangster culture in the popular consciousness but also influenced real gangsters and mafiosi to imitate the film's characters in style and manner of speech. Francis Ford Coppola admitted that he did very little actual research into the gangster culture and that to him the film was a stylistic ""modern myth"" about the Italian-American immigration experience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),slugbelle,10,21 May 2004,"Classics can be seen as old, intimidating, mostly black and white movies... The Godfather doesn't even glimpse at those characteristics, in contrast, it not only enthralls the audience, but also inspires other films relating to its topic.  The 1940s revolved around a tone that was dark, and uninviting to sympathy, while The Godfather actually triggers extreme emotion towards the, otherwise seen as, ""bad guys.""  "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fusionarena,10,6 June 2003,The Godfather is probably the most well crafted film ever made. No true fan of film will deny this piece of art. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino turn in amazing performances. James Caan and Robert Duvall are equally brilliant. The cinematography is among the best I've seen and the lighting is nearly perfect.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),laura-69549,10,16 August 2020,"Wow! When I came out the Godfather for the first time that was first thing I said, wow. I guess that one word can mean a lot of things but to me it was just short for 'this movie is amazing and I've never seen anything like it ever and I'm glad I can say that i've watched it'. The problem was, the first time I watched it, I had to asked my dad half the time what the hec these guys were talking about or who was killing who'. But the second time I watched it, I understood every word and really got into it. Cause, it's a classic and I'm that kind of person who loves to watch some of those great old films like On the Waterfront or the French Connection. And the The Godfather wasn't like any of them. The story was amazing and god forbid the fantastic dialogue but I think that the film's strong point is the acting. Well, when you've got Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall attached to a movie then you kind of already know it's gonna be amazing. And it was. Marlon Brando really deserved his Oscar for playing the extremely iconic role of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan all deserved there nominations as well. Personally, I don't think there's anything really wrong with this film. The cinematography is wonderful, I've mentioned the acting and the writing, the costumes are superb and the violence is as brutal as it is compelling. If you have the time, then watch this masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mikkelsen-Frederikke,10,1 October 2012,"This movie may have comes out 25 years before i was born, but recently my mom came home with the 40th anniversary edition. I just finished watching the first and second film, they are amazing i just can't stop talking about them. I love the power games there is between everyone. Im not much for gangster or action films, but this really got to me. It was amazing to watch it on blue ray the light was perfect. I enjoyed every little part of this film, and didn't seem to noticed it lasted almost 3 hours. I don't ever write reviews but this was a film i think everyone should watch, its a timeless masterpiece which I'm sure would could be enjoyed by many in my generation. And the acting is superb, but Al never seems to disappoint me."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sojicko,10,8 June 2019,"I mostly love the first part!
I can easily say the best movie ever made.
Actors are amazing, the writing is brilliant 10/10!
100% Worth watching"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Coffee_in_the_Clink,10,20 December 2020,"""The Godfather"" is not only the greatest crime drama ever made, it is true perfection in every cinematic aspect. Coppola's directing is flawless, the performances and casting could not have been better, and the story based on Mario Puzo's novel is incredible in its intricate portrayal of a number of years during the twilight reign of an aging mafia Don, as he begins to disassemble his leadership over the family's business affairs and hand them over to his sons in the midst of an all-out war between New York City's Mafia families."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cheryl-81182,9,12 May 2020,"The plot is not complicated, but it gives people a profound impression inadvertently."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bigsportslive,10,3 February 2023,"This movie works so properly as it takes vicinity in an underworld wherein we're so embedded that we do now no longer even study it. Coppola places us instantly withinside the smack-dab middle of what is, admittedly, a society made via way of means of criminals for criminals. It is likewise the cause why it is so welcoming. We are surrounded via way of means of its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, guys who see crime like a nine to five process masquerading as honorable guys. And I do suggest guys. From the outside, we might simplest witness the horrifying, demanding manifestations in their properly-concept out actions."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),brendanmcc02,10,31 December 2020,"The Godfather is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Coppola's deliberate directing, coupled with a superb script, elegant editing, crisp cinematography, sensational score and potent performances contribute to a staggering cinematic experience. A Magnificent Mafia Masterpiece, dissecting the human desire for power and the fortitude of the familial bond; told with an intricate web of carefully weaved plot lines and meticulously motivated characters."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),letrias,10,27 January 2002,"I have seen many films far more ambitious in their scope and execution, I have seen more than a dozen films that made far more important statements about the world, and I have seen films that moved me far beyond anywhere The Godfather could have moved me.  But can the greatness of this film really be denied by anyone with even a vague knowledge about the filmmaking process? To call this film garbage is idiocy, there is no excuse, anyone who might make such a statement obviously has no clue about movies, even if they try to state otherwise.  Despite the fact that in many ways it glamorizes the criminal life, The Godfather is the peek of excellence in film.  It's a shame that people buy into the gangster formula created by Hollywood, it's a worse shame that people expect it, and when they do not see it they demand it!  This film breaks out of the formula, and it does so shamelessly, but it doesn't do it thoughtlessly.  There are truly excellent ironic statements all throughout the film, it surprises me that some people who claim to have some knowledge about film miss them.  The baptism that Michael Corleone attends is just one example, the shots of the baptism are juxtaposed with intercut shots of brutal killings taking place at approximately the same time, killings that were ordered by Michael as he took over the ""family business"".  It's a very powerful scene, almost revolting, it creates a very definite question mark as to the glamorous nature of the first part of the film.  Once again, this is far from the greatest film, but it's a definite 10 - there is no question about it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),snoopdogg-86738,10,5 April 2020,I thought this movie was a masterpiece is definitely better then part 2
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),allanvillatoro,10,21 September 2016,"The best drama I've ever seen. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando had amazing performances. This has been the most important role for Al Pacino, and he has achieved the fame with this movie. I like very much the Vito Corleone's voice and role. It's unforgettable. I like the Robert Duvall's role too. The plot is very interesting and thought provoking. It has many elements like drama situations, crimes, and romances too. I also think that this is the best crime movie about Sicilian mafia. When I was watching the film for the first time, I was paying much attention and trying to figure it out. Maybe, you have to watch it two times at least for best understanding."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),boyya,10,29 October 2001,"This movie is absolute perfection, and now that it is out on DVD, it is something that must be owned.  If you haven't seen it then make it a point to do so. It is amazing that this movie was made in just 62 days.  The acting in this is fantastic, and worthy of the highest praise, this movie can be nothing less than a 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cosmin_paul_18,10,25 November 2016,"To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),timoteo1892,10,19 March 2014,"In 1972, one based on a bestselling film written by Mario Puzo emerged. The saga of the Corleone family is like a tragic opera, soaked in blood and deafened by the noise of the guns. The shooting marked by disagreements between the director and producers. A film that addresses violence, mafia, family and love. Yes, the love a father has for his family. Cynical characters under a humanized view maintains the essence of the work, no one is who is by chance, are the circumstances that define their choices, all for a greater good: the good of the family. A metaphor for America in the history of The Godfather is clear from the first moment, Francis Ford Coppola holds a dramatic power of passages of the book by Mario Puzo turning a great book into a powerful film, both in its aesthetics and in its essence. The Godfather is my favorite movie, and undoubtedly one of the most important films in history. The most talked about, imitated and revered film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Angelaclarissa,10,12 March 2022,"Wow this movie was really that great, i hope for who doesnt watch this film you must watch this movie. The cast, character all was great.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CTHCboy894,10,28 August 2001,"All I can say is that this is the best movie of all time.  it has a great plot, excellent acting, great costume and set design, outstanding direction, and a very beautiful soundtrack.  The Godfather has many famous scenes such as the restaurant scene when Michael(Al Pacino) kills Solozzo(Al Lettieri) and McCluskey(Sterling Hayden), and when the movie pezzonovante wakes up with the severed head of his prized horse in his bed.  There's the brutal killing of Sonny, the gunning of Don Vito(Marlon Brando) across from his office, the car bombing of Apollonia, and the opening scene with Amerigo Bonasera(Salvatore Corsitto) telling the Don about how his daughter was beaten brutally."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Duck_of_Death23,10,31 May 2001,"""America has made my fortune."" This is the opening quote to The Godfather and in my opinion, the best movie in American history. And what would America be without it's greatest cinema-piece? It would be a nation lost of entertainment, a nation without a character as undeniable as Marlon Brando's Godfather. Without him, there would be a missing link to every actor in the history of cinema minus the few previous such as Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca. The performance of he convinces anyone that Don Vito Corleone is truly alive. Not only alive in the film,  but alive as an actual person who speaks to us in volumes, a man who's moral guidelines and love for his family make him a respectable role model, even though he is the head of a mafia family. Don Corleone reaches out to all that see this movie and he is instantly respected as a person of honor, one who we know is of high power, yet is more a democrat rather than a fascist like other corrupt crime lords. Sonny, his son is in fact, fascist in a manner of speech and it shows when he must take over the business. Tragically, Michael the youngest son of the Corleone family is molded into the form of ""zero tolerance"" throughout the picture. The film really isn't about the Mafia; it's about family. The most important thing in The Godfather isn't the rise of power or the loss of it, only how much the other people in your life mean to you."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fwillie14,10,18 August 2000,"I see this movie at least 1 per month, and i love everything about it. The actors could not be chosen better, Marlon Brando made his best presentation. The Godfather raise Al Pacino and Robert Duvall to glory. It is the cinema masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Matukaz17,9,5 January 2022,"The determination of Vito that Michael inherits is brutal, it is not a determination that grates with recklessness (as is the case of Santino), it is a determination that waits patiently, as in that dialogue from Cómodo in Gladiator, about the waiting viper. This aspect of the film may come from the same book, but the distant glances of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino before the problems seem incredible to me, of how they plan and ruminate thoughts and plans simply sitting in a chair. I love this movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),valentineclaraVC,10,4 September 2020,"Piece of Art!!! Simply amazing movie , every person needs to see this, it teaches you many things in life, gives you inteligence and experience the movie like you've been there and came across all of those !! simply breath taking!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),boodykita,9,5 June 2022,"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),konstancyempire,10,18 September 2019,"The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that's very believable. The movie follows the Corleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Corleones refuse to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this go crazy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),simonokill,10,7 August 2016,"I have watched The Godfather so many times I'd be rich for every dollar viewed, that said, I cannot fault this cinematic masterpiece, that perfectly romanticizes organized crime. The characters develop especially Al Pacino's Michael, but all the actors have something to do and say and in a style that has today become synonymous with Coppola. The violence is stylized like a 1950s movie. The dialogue moves every scene forward. It breaks every rule by starting with a wedding and it works. Coppola has great fun with every scene, so evident in his use of family members, notably Talia Shire. Writing this has made me want to watch it again. Perfection!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),boarpeti,10,19 August 2016,"This movie is phenomenal. Coppola's masterpiece one of my favorite movie. Great casting, great writing, great directing. Coppola has made one of the best cult movies of all time. This movie aged well, his 34 years old but still has a strong cultural influence. Al Pacino, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are insane. They acting is phenomenal. This movie has a really strong part. The Godfather is not just a mafia movie, it's not a move just for the mafia and crime movie fans, this movie is recommended for everyone. The movie has a great artistic approach and a great message. The movie is so memorable a lasts for a life."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TonnerBowow,10,24 May 2020,"There is a reason this is universally appraised as one of the greatest films of all time. Because it is. The story of Michael growing into the man of the family following Vito Corleones attempted assassination is entrancing and keeps viewers engaged throughout the course of the film. Although the pace is incredibly slow as most scenes are dialogue heavy, I believe it works with the film to create a story more about characters rather than one about fighting and explosions. Some people may not be able to sit through slow films like these, but those of you who are, will enjoy this film with all your heart."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Puroo,9,7 October 2021,"I'm gonna be a little too honest here. I only watched The Godfather in peer pressure. I don't even like old Hollywood films. I always start feeling drowsy while watching them. Not only is the camera quality too bleak, but the accent of the time was also very illegible. But this one was fun to watch. I saw it on Prime Video and took multiple sittings to watch this. I finished it 6 months ago but I remember seeing it like it was yesterday. Being from India, I have always thought of 70's films to be very family friendly and musical. But this isn't one of them. This one, in simple words, is metal."

In my own words, film is created to mirror society and to broaden your experiences while living on this earth through the moving motion pictures. What I experienced through this film was how to respect family morals, different contrast to business behavior, and most importantly how to discern who to trust. This film tells a thorough storyline from beginning to end. It's not just a mobster movie, but a family and business movie as well that journey's you through the never ending trials and tribulations that can come with working with a family business.

After seeing the film there are too many to choose from. This movie changed the life and careers of so many super star actors. Stars such as Robert Dinero and Al Pacino. The Director of Photography Gordon Willis's is considered a revolutionary person. Throughout the movie characters are shot in semi-darkness. The Studio executives were not to pleased with this but as it turns out they were wrong. George Lucas who is a great friend of the Director Francis Ford Coppola to not make The God Father because it would not change the way movies are made in Hollywood. George Lucas could not be more further than truth.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gsilecchia,10,19 May 2024,"Reflecting on ""The Godfather,"" it's hard not to feel immersed in a cinematic experience that transcends mere entertainment. This film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, is much more than a mafia story; it's a meditation on family, power, and morality. Every time I revisit it, I discover new nuances and details that make me appreciate the work even more. The plot follows the Corleone family, one of the most powerful mafia families in New York, led by the charismatic and feared Don Vito Corleone, masterfully portrayed by Marlon Brando. Don Vito is a complex character, blending brutality and compassion in an unsettling balance. His presence dominates the film, but it's the journey of his son Michael, played by a young and intense Al Pacino, that provides the emotional backbone of the story. Michael starts as an outsider to the family business, but slowly gets drawn into the criminal world, transforming from a reluctant war hero to a ruthless mafia boss. One of the most memorable scenes for me is the wedding scene that opens the film. It's a masterpiece of visual storytelling, introducing the main characters and their dynamics in a natural and fluid way. The music, the laughter, and the whispered conversations in the corridors create a festive atmosphere that magnificently contrasts with the shadow of violence looming over everything. Coppola uses this scene to set the tone of the film, showing how family life and criminal affairs are inseparably intertwined. The cast is simply extraordinary. Besides Brando and Pacino, we have James Caan as Sonny, the fiery and impulsive elder brother, and Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the family's Irish-American consigliere. Each actor brings depth and credibility to their role, making the Corleone family feel alive and palpable. Even minor characters, like Fredo, played by John Cazale, and Kay, Michael's girlfriend played by Diane Keaton, add layers of complexity to the narrative. Coppola's direction is meticulous and rich in detail. Every shot is carefully crafted, every camera movement serves a purpose. I've always been struck by the use of chiaroscuro and shadows, reflecting the duality of the characters and their actions. The restaurant shooting scene, with Michael killing Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, is a perfect example of tension built through direction and editing. The deafening silence, the ticking of the clock, the distant sound of the train - everything contributes to creating a breathtaking moment of suspense. Nino Rota's soundtrack is equally iconic. The music of ""The Godfather"" is both elegant and melancholic, capturing the essence of the Corleone family and their world. Each musical theme is associated with a specific character or emotion, amplifying the impact of the scenes. Despite its length, the film never loses its pace. Every scene is necessary, every dialogue carries weight. Subplots, like the rivalry with other mafia families and Michael's tragic love story in Sicily, seamlessly intertwine with the main narrative. Every decision, every action has consequences that ripple through the entire family, making the story gripping and full of suspense. If I were to rate ""The Godfather,"" it would undoubtedly be a 10. It's one of those rare films that manages to be perfect in almost every aspect - from acting to direction, from screenplay to soundtrack. But beyond its technical perfection, what truly makes it extraordinary is its ability to touch on universal themes through a particular story. It's a film about power, loyalty, love, and loss in a way that resonates deeply with the viewer. ""The Godfather"" is not just a masterpiece of cinema, but a work that continues to influence and inspire. Every viewing offers new discoveries, new moments of reflection. It's a journey into the dark heart of humanity, told with a beauty and mastery that remain unmatched. If you haven't seen it yet, it's an experience worth having. And if you've already seen it, you know well that it's a film you always come back to with pleasure."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),LW-08854,9,27 December 2023,"This film is considered a real classic of cinema, is it the greatest film of all time? Let's see. The 1940s setting is wonderfully recreated here in the fashions, the cars, the interior set decorations. The film all is a very good looking one, I loved the colours, the textures, the use of shadow. This is a long film, and I did think the wedding scene goes on too long. The film also gives us both an inside and outside perspective on the family using various techniques. Certain lines have become iconic and I also enjoyed the fact that there was some great character development. Our main character's instance that he is not his family starts to ring hollow as he becomes increasingly drawn into their murky world. Power corrupts too in this movie and I loved the performances in this film, they are so much more subtle than you might think. I thought that James Caan is brilliant in this movie, the sun drenched photography when the story also moves to Italy looks gorgeous. The soundtrack in this film is also something you cannot associate with anything other than this genera. While the film is technically superb it's really the deep theme within this movie that leave the most lasting impression."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),david-castellani,10,14 July 2006,"This is one of those movies that will consume your life after first glance. It's one of those movies that you would always hear people talk about and wondered 'what's all the hype - could a movie that was made prior to your birth really be that great?' Well, at least that is what I wondered. I never understood the fascination with Al Pacino, well at least until I watched this film. When I first laid eyes and ears on the first one, I could not put it down. I must have watched it at least 10 times consecutively and just fell in love with it's powerful and captivating presence. There is a reason that this film is on the top of the IMDb Charts. All the pieces that make this film so brilliant somehow magically fell into place when this film was made. For such a great director such as Francis Ford Coppola to come across one of the 20th century's greatest novels - The Godfather was destiny. Francis knew to truly captivate mastermind he wouldn't go it alone for the script. Yes, he dove passionately into the project and a lot of the film's ideas were sparked and derived by initial interest. But being the fanatical director that Coppola was, he set sail to take the project into timeless space. To do this, he knew he had to include Mario Puzo (author of the Godfather book) in on the script. Even casting took Coppola by storm and he was in for much labored conflict and tough decisions in order to see out his vision. Hollywood being Hollywood and Paramount in it's scope originally rejected the idea of casting young and unrecognized actor Al Pacino to play the role of Michael. But Coppola knew better and thus fought hard to keep him in. Thank goodness because any other actor could not play such an untouchable role that only Al Pacino could fill; The makings of such a dynamic and powerful role. Marlon Brando was probably the sure-shot out of the whole cast and well, Marlon Brando certainly pulled through. For me, it's Marlon Brandon's lack of presence in the 2nd that makes the first topple the second. The beginning of Godfather one with Marlon Brandon as ""The Don"" Vito Corleone sitting at his desk addressing Bonasera's request before he steps out for his daughter's wedding is simply timeless. That powerful message which in it's own right from the film and in the book carries even deeper and more powerful messages in analogies and sub-meanings is delivered on a timeless measure that puts chills down your spine almost every time you watch it. That deeply rooted sub-context makes it tireless, restless and relentless enough where hearing it a billion times is not enough. And is the perfect intro to a mastermind film -- letting you know that something mysterious and powerful is approaching."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nuochoachiaki,10,31 August 2022,"The movie is so good, I can watch it over and over again without getting bored."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TahmidTaseen,9,3 May 2020,"I saw it first when i was a kid and understood nothin!... Watching after im 20,.. I found it as a masterpiece !!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),moise-1,10,2 May 2004,"Probably the best movie about criminal world, which shows all sides of people life who are involved and how their life is changed by very powerful force. And the movie about the young man who saves not his real family but also people who are even closer... The Plot makes a huge effect on viewers feelings and emotions while characters battle between life and death. This is probably the best performance of Pacino and Brando. In my opinion everyone who sees this movie will absolutely say it is good and will understand waht godfather means. Power not only makes people to fear the don but love as well, because that power if is used well it effects life in many different ways: help, destroy, make cry or smile and understand the true values of family and close friends."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),snagadream,10,18 March 2023,"This is it. This is the original. Every other crime/mafia film made after this, was based upon this film. That is what this classic did for the art of film making. Before this, every crime movie tried to capture and display events. Francis Ford Coppola brought us into the life and captured the spirit and tradition of the Corleone family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),parskara,9,31 March 2024,"It contains many metaphors about life and you can learn from it. Great acting, great shots and an excellent movie. The acting is like something out of a real crime world. You will get a different taste every time you watch it. It inspired many crime movies and TV series to be shot later with its characters, shooting and subject. If you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely watch the movie as soon as possible. Of course, don't forget to watch the sequel. As a whole, it is a masterpiece. Of course, I advise you not to take these as a positive example in your life, but to take them wisely."

the best"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MB_West_Lafayette,10,11 April 2020,"First of all, this is THE ultimate guys movie. Phrases like ""Drop the gun, get the cannoli"" have never been topped in American movie history. This is the kind of movie you want to watch with your pals while drinking beer. The story is just great. That and Brando's acting make it a 10 in entertainment.
The Godfather is almost a documentary of the Mafia Progress in America (forget Pilgrim's Progress). Most of the scenes are related to some real event. Of course they are all put together into a single story-line for entertainment but it does paint an accurate picture; Vito, the old Don with humane instincts, Michael, the ruthless and efficient successor, the roots in Brooklyn, the rise in NY, the move to Vegas, everything.
Then there are the characters; Brando telling Michael that he has no regrets, except that he couldn't achieve more so Michael could be a ""Governor"" or something, that he had never walked on anybody's string, etc. The very image of the self-made man. Michael, descending from Straight and Gentle to making an offer that Moe Green couldn't refuse. The Family, which is a composite character that pervades everything and justifies everything. And on and on... so many contrasts, so much going on.
This movie could only be made in America. It shows a raw and powerful side. It is Metaphor because it reflects the rest of the country. It is cultural because it educates. And the Finale is Epic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),albertsagan,10,11 June 2011,"1. The acting. Every performance in this film is believable. You forget they are acting and really believe they are the characters. 2. The pace. Not too slow, not too fast, just right. 3. The music. Perfect! 4. Character introduction, character development. All the major characters are introduced in a way, and then you see how they change. 5. The details, sounds, etc. You really get the sense of the decade they are in. The phones, cars, restaurants etc all feel authentic. 6. There is a love story, but too mushy, and it does not detract from the film. 7. There is some comedy, but in small subtle doses, and does not take away the serious of the film. 8. Suspense and surprises. 9. the most memorable opening scene of all time, arguably. 10. The impact on pop culture. Scenes, lines, etc. That are now part of our every day vocabulary."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Aaydin95,10,18 April 2022,"It's one of the unique movies. It's not just a crime, mafia movie but it has lots of emotional moments as well.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eJay-03930,10,27 August 2023,"""The Godfather,"" released in 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences worldwide.

I thank Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for this film and I hope we will see Coppola back in action soon. The acting as well is brilliant and Marlon Brando as the godfather,he is just amazing.This film only recieved three Oscars and it should have got more. This is a film about the mob or the ""cosa nostra"" but it is also a film about family and friendship.It`s a very touching film and a very beautiful film. This is the ultimate film and I love it. So it doesn`t get any better than this and to all of you out there who haven`t seen it,you don`t know what you`re missing. This is the BEST!!!!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ethanwenrin,10,16 December 2020,I think is an amazing movie with great characters and a unique music.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),yuzou-45815,9,12 April 2020,"The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, the music is soothing and sad, and the interests of the game are conflicting human nature. Whether it is acting or the use of lenses and music, it gives people a beautiful enjoyment. And watching this movie is extremely necessary to sink your heart to taste carefully, and you can have a new feeling whenever you come back and revisit."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AuroraLaude,10,14 June 2021,"Al Pacino has played many great characters in motion pictures, including Serpico, Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Bobby Deerfield, Tony Montana, Frank Slade, Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno, and Jimmy Hoffa. The role for which he will be remembered is Michael Corleone. Pacino carries the entire trilogy, surfacing as the main protagonist in the first film opposite Marlon Brando. Brando got people into the theaters, but Pacino was the reason they kept coming back. Regarded as one of the best films in cinematic history, The Godfather is a classic story about the struggle of immigrants to America and the means one family pursues in order to rise from poverty. In addition to Pacino and Brando, John Cazale delivers an outstanding performance."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eldreddsouza,10,19 May 2021,"I'll be honest, when I watched this film as a 16 year old I had given it a 5 on IMDb. Back then I found it long, slow and boring and wondered why it had such high ratings. What can I say? I was really dumb and stupid at that time. Now at 22, I feel so ashamed for my thoughts about this film in the past. This is a fricking Perfect film. Release in1972, I can only imagine what waves it must have created around the world back then. The characters, their development, the story, acting and everything are solid! Yes it is long and may feel slow paced, but I don't know how 3 hours passed by. An absolute Masterpiece!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Dhruvitkumar_Talati,10,27 March 2019,Godfather All time Fav and most famous acting style
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),advaitkamthekar,10,14 September 2020,"The godfather is a staggering piece of art. It's flawless and mind blowing. It's a magnificent portrait of organised crime with marvellous performances. This movie was way ahead of its time . Basically when it came to creating Italian-American crime dramas , the 1900's was the perfect time. That era had such a charisma that these types of movies just feel so...perfect. It's a very serious movie which demands your attention at certain times. There's no action, no chills giving music rather jazz, no comedy just a serious movie about gangs and crime families that goes on for 3 hours. Not most people may like that but If you are more into dialogues and screenplay and can understand the true intensity and purpose of such films...you'll love it like I do. The actors don't feel the actors themselves at all , they feel the characters they are playing. Such a brilliant set of cast and chilling performances by both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino .This type of story telling and scriptwriting cannot be seen nowadays. It's truly an amazing period piece. ""This movie is an offer you can't refuse""
If you are gonna watch it then make sure that you watch it in one go cause the rhythm of such movie should not be broken.
10/10 Masterpiece!👍🏻✌🏼"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),samuelracicot,10,27 November 2017,"This movie series is a lot inspiring to explain the world we are leaving in. It's Such an inspiration source! Directed as genius Actors where Good, Marlon Brando has his colors as usual it one of my best source of motivation. Thanks for having produce this master piece. Wrote for the knowledge of generations coming. Instructive, also mysterious, the action is closed to reality, just a bit more stunts would be better :), but why change a perfect classic art. This movie is like an old wine that get better from years to years. Someday, my objective is to create a Montreal peace of art like this reminding our society."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),j-montilla-93722,10,18 December 2019,"Its hard to describe the acting in this film, but to me the acting was so artistic that it felt like I was watching moving art in a film metaphorically speaking. Even if you are someone who doesn't like gangster films, I feel like this film can be enjoyed by an audience of any genre. The way the story was acted out and slowly unraveled throughout the movie was beautifully done. My favorite character obviously was The Godfather himself, I can't picture any other actor being able to pull off what Al Pacino did in this film and this is one of the big reasons why is one of my top five favorite actors. This film had everything from romance, action, drama, horror ( in a way). One of the very few movies I ever watched and couldn't think of anything I didn't like about it"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cinemapersonified,10,13 June 2023,"Rating: 9.6
Overall, and Incredible Movie that stands up to being 'One of the best movies ever made' as it is the definition of subtly and symbolism (helping drive the story forward and influencing the characters decisions/emotions) in a movie as Coppola delivers a magnum opus not only in his career but for the whole film industry (something that others have tried to learn from)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),treadwaywrites,10,16 July 2006,"When one thinks of film masterpiece, ""The Godfather"" is certainly high on the list. I wish my review could have been written in 1972, but today will have to do. Rightly labeled, ""Godfather"" is in the top ten ultimate guy movies of all time. In many circles it is required viewing before labeling yourself a man."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),gameofthronetop,10,16 July 2017,"Just the best movie of all time. Performances,dialogues,shots,camera work,sound, just everything is perfect about this movie. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone a.k.a ""The Godfather"" is a gem to this world of cinema. Both The Godfather 1 and The Godfather 2 are equally good in my opinion but cannot say the same about The Godfather 3."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),parthopfolia,10,21 October 2023,"This film's screenwriting is truly a bibliography for a filmmaker and an amazing story. It is such a masterpiece that everyone should watch this film. This is a beautifully crafted film about a gangster. Amazing actors, directors, and producers! THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of filmmaking, an epic in the truest sense of the word, and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. The film has an operatic quality, yet it's more understated than flamboyant. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.... It was carefully crafted."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),erebustormert,10,9 December 2023,"The film, despite being a masterpiece that has persisted throughout history, has managed to maintain its position at the summit for me, both up to now and in the future. Reflecting a family life in a dramatic way that anyone, regardless of age, can easily empathize with, this work achieves a unique success without compromising on realism. With its deeply poignant meanings that send shivers down the spine, it not only pulls the audience into a captivating story but also succeeds in touching universal emotions. The film stands out not only as a tribute to the past but also as an inspiration for the future. While each scene harbors a separate story, it invites the audience on an emotional adventure. This unparalleled work goes beyond art, offering an experience that delves into profound thoughts, leaving an unforgettable impact on its viewers."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lionesss,10,3 November 1998,"Truly the best movie of all time, except for perhaps Part II.  Marlon Brando is unforgettable.  Al Pacino as Michael Corleone- probably one of the better performances on film.  Ever.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  The end comes together very nicely, though the loss of Michael's innocence through his first hit is heartbreaking."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mjmirando,10,12 November 2022,"Even though my dad named me over the actor of Godfather and even though he thought I will turn out to be a gangster I never wanted to watch this movie since it was a bit old.

The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema. This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions. Thanks for making this movie."

There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benowen-91207,10,22 April 2019,"The never ending debate of the best film of all time, the godfather or citizen Kane, doesn't have a clear answer
Personally I love citizen Kane and I respect it more than nearly any other movie (especially considering the time it came out) but that still doesn't mean it trumps Francis-Ford Coppala's masterpiece.
At its core this film is about every pro and con of the mafia. It treats it as necessary evil, but also shows that even the good people in society can easily be corrupted by its power (this is more relevant in the film's fantastic sequel).
If you haven't seen this film yet then watch it. You'll either love it or think it's overrated but you still won't regret the experience"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),robsellke,10,29 September 2000,"""The Godfather"" is one of those movies that everyone has heard of, everyone knows scenes of, and is quoted, parodied, and paralleled in everything from major movies to children's cartoons.  There's the raspy voice of Don Corleone, the bloody horse's head in bed, and the actors for which the film defined their careers (Robert Duvall, Al Pacino that make this film).  All of these things make this film a unique addition to American cinema and a classic to remember for years.  The plot follows the trail of the Corleone family for several years after the assassination attempt of the family patriarch, Don Corleone (Marlon Brando).  After the Don is unsuccessfully gunned down by five shots from rival's gang, his son Michael (Al Pacino) is forced to take over through a series of unfortunate events.  One of the beautifully tragic events in this movie is Michael's transition from naive to a mob leader in his father's name.  This movie has it all-action, drama, love, beauty, and politics.  It is a must-see of American Film and a institution for mafia films and will be for years to come."

One of the standout features of ""The Godfather"" is its exceptional storytelling. The movie masterfully weaves together multiple subplots, each with its own set of characters and conflicts, and seamlessly integrates them into the larger narrative of the Corleone family's rise to power.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ark-88183,10,19 May 2019,"I was very late to see this one. But once I watched I got to know ""Why"" it's the Best . Actually it should be at the top.The music, writing, screenplay , dialogue everything is so perfect.
I don't know few people say part-1 is better than the other two parts but for me all three parts were best as per the story was going, no doubt first godfather has some supreme actors that's the real fact that makes 1st part a bit edge to win."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MovieGirl01,10,4 March 2002,"This film has all the elements it takes to make an excellent movie.  Based on Mario Puzo's novel, it provides an insight on an Italian mob family in New York: The Corleones. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando give incredible performances as Michael Corleone and Don Vito Corleone. Keeping you at the edge of your seat throughout, it's probably the best movie I've ever seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Backstage_Dave,10,24 March 2024,"As someone who experienced the gritty reality of Brooklyn's ghetto in the 1970s without the guidance of positive male role models, ""The Godfather"" presents a complex and, at times, conflicting narrative."

The Godfather is a masterpiece of epic proportions."

I've read them to learn something from them, to learn how to live in the broadest sense of the term, and there were books which offered me support. I agree with other reviews, this movie also has great Gifs. Most watch and read."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),melody1,10,13 January 2004,"An instant classic...marvelous acting, beautiful cinematography, and a perfect musical score.  Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel is possibly the greatest film ever made.  Simply riveting from beginning to end.  This movie stands the test of time, even more than 30 years later.  The epic saga of the Corleone family is the first and only movie of it's genre to win best picture.  A must for your DVD collection."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),smashmouthscuba,10,20 November 2006,"This movie really did change my life. It was absolutely breathtaking and so complete in film quality. I have never seen so flimed and completed so well and there was a near perfect movie of that type, it would be the Godfather. You look at the cast of people in this movie and these people were made stars because of this movie or already were stars; Al Pacino,James Caan, Marlon Brando, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and the list goes on. The storyline was unbelievable with a plot that was constantly evolving and the commitment to accuracy and staying true to Puzo's novel written years earlier. People actually spoke Italian in this movie and you really felt that they were their characters because they sold it to you that well. I still look at Brando, Caan and Pacino and say, ""Your the Godfather who started it all, your Sonny with rage and ferocity and Pacino is the up and coming Godfather who is the most sinister and clever Godfather there ever was."""

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),zombiji,10,14 October 2018,"I just watched this on Netflix. Can't remember if i'd ever seen it but that's a good thing. I could compare it to modern cinema in a fresh way and I must say, despite the 3 hour length I was captivated the whole way through! Al Pacino and Brando brought this one home."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrbluto,10,8 July 2000,"The Godfather is one of the two or three best movies ever made, A skillfully crafted movie that looks into the heart of a mob family. Micheal is a war hero wanting to stay out of the family business untill his father is shot, After that all bets are off, Al Pacino gives a calm yet chilling preformance as Mike. Well written the movie zips along with no dull parts. 10 out of 10"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dogac-gk,10,12 May 2014,"The best of the series ever. Rearing up of American Cinema started after the production of this Movie. This compelling movie of mafia and family life is superb in every department, writing, acting, directing, a highlight of Coppola's career as well as of New American Cinema. Don't miss an opportunity to see a classic such as this on the big screen. The Godfather films remain so powerful, so ubiquitous, because in the Corleones we see the American Dream -- and in turn, ourselves. So it's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the ""Godfather"" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're also cultural touchstones. El grand!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),p_jamous,9,23 April 2023,"It is one of the iconic movies that come only once in a while with a package full of old movies nostalgia, family affairs, social relations, and a great script that you can not get bored of and can watch as many times as you want."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),saadanathan,9,25 May 2020,"Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo created one of the greatest movies ever made and that's a fact: the story of Michael Corleone rising to power and becoming the successor of his father. This story is also about family, betrayal, honor, power, and fear of life of others. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are simply the best in their roles. Top of their careers. The cinematography of shadows by Gordon Willis (prince of darkness) is the best cinematography ever seen. How the characters are always in the dark, half of their faces are covered in the dark to show their evil nature and the other half of their faces is in bright light to show they are family and they have weaknesses. My favorite sequence is when Michael's nephew is born and baptized and in the same time all the family headmasters are killed one by one. When Michael is being asked if he renounces the devil and says yes, All the enemies are being killed one by one and Michael is aware of it. Not only he lies but he becomes the only thing he wanted to stay away from... The Godfather."

I can say that the movie has a rightful place in the history of cinema thanks to the depth of the characters, the fluidity of the story and its unique atmosphere.

From its captivating storytelling to its impeccable performances, this film grips you from start to finish. Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone and Al Pacino's mesmerizing transformation as Michael Corleone are nothing short of brilliant. The film effortlessly blends crime, family, and loyalty, creating a rich and compelling narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With its stunning cinematography, powerful dialogue, and memorable score, The Godfather is a true cinematic gem that defines the gangster genre. A must-watch for any film lover."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Mr. Blockbuster,10,20 January 2001,"The Godfather is a definitive example of cinematic perfection.  There is nothing lacking from the film; acting, direction, cinematography; all perfect.  And, like any good American classic, it becomes better with every viewing.  Marlon Brando seems to get all the credit, but I believe Al Pacino delivered the film's greatest performance, as well as one of cinema's greatest.  The Godfather is timeless, and will be treasured for decades to come."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),shlomikli,10,9 January 2001,"""The Godfather"",and lots of people will agree with me,is the greatest movie ever made.there aren't many people who didn't see that movie,there aren't many people who won't see that movie more then once."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sheepiscuteenough,8,6 May 2019,"It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),f-62204-72175,10,21 May 2023,"When I went to watch this movie the first thing I thought was ""Everyone talks so well about this movie so it's either going to be really good movie or an okay movie that is highly overrated."". Both of the options were wrong. This is not an overrated film and it isn't just a really good movie, it's a almost perfect movie. The only default of this movie is a scene where a character is beating the other up and it's very clear that the punches aren't landing. But it's such a minor default compared to everything other thing that this movie does perfectly, plus at time it was really hard filming those type of scenes without looking like they aren't actually landing punches. The acting, the script, the direction everything on this movie is perfect. And I don't get why people complain about it being long since the movie is so well done that you don't even feel the time passing. Perfect movie to to bottom, I highly recommend."

The story is continuously a work of art that never stops. I really love the performance of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando, they are truly both well suited for this types of movies. No wonder that Al Pacino is doing the characters he does. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),statistikaanomalos,9,9 May 2018,"Coppola's Godfather is a landmark for gangster movies combining accurate storytelling, quality production, artistic freedom when necessary and a slow paced rhythm, allowing viewers to fully appreciate action scenes.
Al Pacino is also delivering a sample of his future increasing talent along with Marlon Brando, the king of good looks and style"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),newsnake,9,28 November 2019,"N amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),customboxguru,10,18 April 2024,"The Godfather"" stands as a cinematic masterpiece, weaving a captivating narrative of power, family, and morality within the Italian-American mafia. Francis Ford Coppola's direction creates an atmosphere of tension and intrigue, while the performances, notably Marlon Brando's iconic portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, are nothing short of mesmerizing. The film's meticulous attention to detail, from its rich character development to its evocative cinematography, immerses viewers in the dark underworld of organized crime. With its unforgettable quotes, haunting score, and timeless themes, ""The Godfather"" remains a landmark in cinema, leaving an indelible mark on the collective consciousness of audiences worldwide."

It ages well and pays a hefty price, and it's smooth and has legs. Like any fine wine, this classic will be put on the topmost shelf of the cellar."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),the_godfather424,10,7 November 2004,The Godfather is definitely my favourite film of all time. It is never boring. Brando's best. He won an Oscar. The film is absolutely irrisistible. It's original and is perfect on the telling of a mafia empire falling down because of a deal that was turned down. Pacino became a star for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. This is James Caan's best film and is the only film that got him an academy award nomination. Other people that became noticeable are Robert Duvall and John Cazale. For sure it is a 10. I recommend it to everyone. It is not a film to say no to because everything is going right down the line. I am sure it will not be a turn down. I am saying this because I know that it is one of the best films created. It was #3 on #100 of the afi's top 100 films list.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),khouston86,10,15 February 2003,"This is the best movie I have ever seen.  It literally transports you into another world the first time you see it.  With the slow panning shot in the dark room, it seems to intend to do just that.        Reading some of the negative reviews here, I am reminded of just how different people can be in this world.  I can't imagine giving this movie a negative review.  Incredibly intense and emotional, beautifully shot, dramatically delivered, rings completely true.  The best ensemble performance ever. The best performance of Brando's career. This is simply the perfect movie. I confess that I have never been able to sit through Citizen Caine, but do not let reviewers here confuse that movie with this one.  Watching this movie is pure joy.        For the unique effect of taking the viewer into another world, I can only think of a few movies anywhere near the same ballpark.  The African Queen comes to mind, Terminator maybe, North By Northwest perhaps, Casa Blanca, Pulp Fiction and Rocky are candidates, maybe Cast Away. (Even First Blood was pretty good at that, strangely enough.  The Outsiders, the book, but not the movie.) Hopefully you get the idea.  This is incredible film-making.     Oh, and by the way, the Godfather is much better than the likes of Goodfellas because it is so much more noble and heroic."

If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part- II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),wy-90259,10,12 June 2020,"The plot is not complicated, but it is inadvertently profound. Marlon Brando's performance is impeccable."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),berkvenef,8,23 November 2023,"The Godfather is a technically educational film with a dark and realistic atmosphere. The cinematographer of the film, Gordon Willis, used shadows and contrast in such a way that when you watch, you say this is the movie. On the one hand, you are watching the dark and beautiful atmosphere, and on the other hand, you are watching the plot. Some people may have been bored in the first scenes while watching the movie, but I wasn't bored because the mafia theme was a theme I liked before. The film tells about the dispute between the Carlone family and Comma Solozzo over his drugged job. Don Carleone politely refuses the offer, calling it a ""druggy"" dirty job, but Solozzo, who is not very pleased with this, personally arranges an assassination of Carleone, causing things to escalate. This is the crucial point of the film. We are watching the characteristic change of Michael, who normally has little to do with family affairs. Michel first kills Solozzo to avenge his father, and then takes over the family business. It's as if that innocent child who was watching family affairs from a distance is gone, instead of a calm but cold killer has arrived. Michael is actually the opposite of his brother Sonny. Sonny is a person who can't control his anger, acts irrationally, while Michael is logical and so calm. No matter how much ""The Godfather"" is a crime movie, it's actually a movie that moves from a father and son relationship. The best example that can be given to this is the scene where Don Vito and Michael are alone. In this scene, Carleone says that he has always worked for his family all his life, and he will not be ashamed to work, but he has not thought about Michael to take over the family until today. It was a pretty good movie for me, but it may not appeal to everyone, I can understand that. The main point that you should focus on in this film is not the mafia life, but that you can't trust anyone but your family and that you have no one but them. Otherwise, why would Kim turn his family into a criminal organization? We also see in the film that almost everyone betrayed the father except his sons.(Comma Solozzo, Tattaglia family, Carlo, Tessio) That's what I meant when I said you can't trust anyone but your family. Finally, I have a cutting message for those who don't like the Godfather and have hated him all their lives: Watch the Godfather not as a mafia movie, but as a father and son movie, because only then can you love this movie. Enjoy the mafia theme if you want, hate it if you want Junkie theme. Thanks for Reading."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),swarajdeb,10,4 September 2022,"The Godfather is such an amazing movie that holds you onto the screen without breaking a lick of your attention, it is just that great of a masterpiece. You can feel the fear of every uncertainty lurking in the next corner along the movie all the time . It is periodic piece never will be seen again not in this lifetime, not . It is something I experienced like once in a lifetime event of watching this movie that came down on me like a miraculous event of diamond shower . Yep Jewels . It showered jewels of emotions all along the movie with a story so captivating that it will give you a feel as if you walk along them and oh the expressions of everyone as they go through the movie behind the cameras we feel them . It was one of the most perfect movies I experienced without a hint of complaint . I just watched it for the first time and this is how I felt and these words were too much to hold onto myself .

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alvaroferreyra,10,7 September 2013,"Great Movie! It shows the life of a true Mafioso, a true Italian man! Anybody that ha sent watch this movie need to! Its just too good! The way the movie is set up, how the family is always first, is just so true. Im Argentine, of Italian descent, and it shows how Italians are, always the family, and you never mess with the family. It shows how the early years of the US Mafia was, even thought this is not based on a true story, it does show how the Mafia was. For those who have not seen this movie and are not sure if they should watch it, i say do it, you truly wont regret it, you will get involve in the movie so fast, and it has so many legendary actors, nothing wrong with this movie, it is one of the greatest movie of all time!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ghosonhasan,8,29 June 2016,"one of the best movies in modern cinemas cant be better,all the actors are amazing and the story line will attach you till the end of the three parts . it seems that all the crews were working with harmony and they did their best to deliver the idea of the director as he imagined it . i think many directors those days tried to make similar stories but nobody succeed till now. I thought this was a normal movie, but when i watched it more than three times i realized that this is one of the best movies more than that really. I personally would call it the greatest movie ever made. It was good, worth watching once,twice and tenth and I'm glad I've finally seen it.i wish our new generation can give to the cinema movies like this or at least very close but unfortunately nowadays its very hard to find team that will bring such a movie"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),alene-56179,10,23 June 2020,"The Godfather is a masterpiece. It is one of the few films without any significant weaknesses (any that I've found, at least) and it's been my favorite film since I first saw it at age 15.
Each and every actor gives a stellar performance, especially Marlon Brando as Don Corleone and Al Pacino as his son Michael. Both men completely disappear into their roles, transforming Mario Puzo's characters into pop culture icons. The pacing of the movie is brilliantly done, keeping the audience wanting more through the whole three-hour runtime. The score by Nino Rota is amazing and has stuck with me long after my last viewing (I will occasionally find myself humming the Love Theme without meaning to), and the writing is brilliant.
I could go on and on about everything that makes this movie a classic, but it really has all been said before. All I have left to say is that you need to see this movie if you haven't already. The Godfather more than lives up to the hype."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),baw1502,10,4 June 2005,"Once you see part 1 you will have to see part 2 and 3 following it. There is just no way around it...This fist time I saw Godfather part 1 I couldn't appreciate it seeing as i was only 10 years old. But now i am 21 and that has changed. I major theme throughout the movie is of course ""family"". This movie can be called the best because it is without a doubt flawless. I challenge you to find anything you didn't like about the film. Mario Puzo is a genius and Marlon Brando acting was excellent. His career was already excellent but i think that after making a film like The Godfather, he will forever be known as Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"". There will never be a film more powerful and remarkable then this."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dancanada77,10,3 December 2014,"An acclaimed film that deserves its acclaim, The Godfather validates the crime epic and explores the dark side of the American dream. The Godfather is simply a classy production; unlike the mass of movies, most of which can each be criticized on some level, The Godfather manages to engage its audience throughout, and the portrayals of Brando, Pacino and Duvall, to name a few, were instant classics. Moreover, the film is memorable, in particular for its performances, assured direction and insightful depiction of the corridors of power of the American Mafia (not to mention it's extremely quotable). I did not give it ten out of ten for this reason: it did not move me so much as some other films. The Godfather is not my favorite movie, but I can see how for many people it is."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),edinaku87,9,4 December 2022,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama.

This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. Whit this movie Marlon Brand, his performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost has not already become a cliche. His performance though was subtle and breathtaking. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),f-44119,10,14 May 2020,"The film is stunningly good, gripping and entertaining. It shows a superb shooting technique, so that each character is molded into a three-dimensional image. This movie could be called ""man's bible"". The charm of the godfather is unique in that all the interests exchanged and the right family values and the love for friends allow you to see yourself again from your own world view. It is a far-reaching romantic epic gangster movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),guitare_cool,10,4 August 2009,"I've seen a lot of movies but I don't think I'm very good at reviewing movies. I love movies that are bad for the majority of people and some movie was Overrated in my opinion. But I have to say that The Godfather surpasses every movie in the history of cinema. From the actors to the story, the the action and to the drama, The Godfather is just outstanding! This movie doesn't deserve the second place on IMDb top 250. It deserves the first place. If you have not seen this movie, I don't know what you were doing all the time because you are missing the greatest movie ever. Watch it NOW! Or I will make you an offer you can't refuse!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),THxRo,10,21 November 2019,"Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),helar,10,11 December 2003,"As far as I'm concerned, there is no other movie that could compete with The Godfather. Having seen it for more than a couple of times, I still find it great. I have read the book for a couple of times and I will read it again after the exams, when I have more time, because it's even better than the movie. I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the movie."

An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why. The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka ""The Godfather"", Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the ""innocent"" son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as ""Tom Hagen"" as the adviser to the Don.

And this movie is a lesson for Bachelor science students under Calicut university. My brother read about this movie from his textbook. The best casting was the top highlight. When I was a kid, I found the poster of godfather on cards. But I did not get any idea about it. Some of my friends read the book. From their information, I saw the movie. It was fantastic. And I know there were some immigrants from Italy. And Italian was a common language in some parts of the USA in 1940's and 1950's. The climax was one of the best movies. A different one. Yes, It is copied for new gen movie. And some scenes are still trying to copy. So we can say, This movie is GODFATHER."

One of the best casts in the history of cinema. This movie was done with the passion that lacks on film making nowadays and thats why it will live forever. It deals with the core of society through a dangerous and loving family. There is just a few film makers out there that keep this true formula alive today and let's hope there is more to come. Coppola has yet to come back and delight us with more. We need more movies like this! Get inspired filmmakers, the world is yours. A movie that changed American film making forever."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),JoeysGirl4Ever,10,28 May 2004,"The Godfather has quickly become this reviewer's favorite dramatic movie. With a mixture of love, action and scandalous plot developments not once in the 175 minutes of watching it did looking at the clock to see how much longer it would be come to mind.  There is such a sympathy created for the Corleone family that you end up rooting for them, even though they are a mafia related family.  It's crazy to think about really, for instance, this reviewer can't remember the last time she felt sympathy for a murderer  The Godfather is amazing, it's well written, and the cast just meshes well on screen.  The names can be confusing because they are all Italian and people address each other by their last name most of the time, but after a while it starts to make a little sense. 	The lead character of the movie is, surprisingly, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  This story follows his coming of age from a young man wishing to get as far away from the business to his deep involvement after some family catastrophes.  Upon first introduction Michael is dressed in his service uniform and bringing a new love, Kay (Diane Keaton), to the wedding of his sister.  When Kay asks about his family, and his father in particular, Michael explains to her that his father is a mafia leader and he wants nothing at all to be like him.  So far, he had been doing very well at trying to keep himself separated, until one day when his father gets shot in the back several times and is put into the hospital.  Well, of course, the henchmen aren't going to be satisfied with just putting him in the hospital, they want to finish the job.  Luckily, Michael goes to visit his father and upon arrival realizes that there is no one there keeping guard over his father.  He calls his brother to get backup and places his father in a different room in the hospital.  The suspense in this scene is SO heavy it's almost suffocating, in a good way.  There are distant footsteps heard coming toward Michael's father and this reviewer felt her hands clench and her heart beat racing; it was so well done.  But this is the point when Michael really starts to enter the mafia; and he only gets deeper and deeper into it as the movie plays out. 	There is, however, one death scene that is a bit too played out.  A character is in a car and suddenly there are a gazillion guys around the car and they all have rapid firing guns.  Well, the character is shot while in the car and proceeds to crawl across the seat and exit out the passenger side of the car.  At which point, the character puts themselves in full exposure to the henchmen.  Why?  No clue, but then another 70 or 80 shots are successfully taken AND THEN one of the henchmen proceeds to take a few shots at close range and throw in a few kicks.  This is a bit excessive upon reflection but at the time, this reviewer almost cried.  It was SO unfair! If it wasn't for the fact that it is completely impossible, jumping into the screen to save the victim was all this reviewer could think of.  Once again, it's amazing because the victim wasn't exactly an angel to say the least. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Insane_Man,9,8 March 2022,"The movie starts with a wedding ceremony where the father of the bride is the boss of an organized crime syndicate. His elder son takes the whole control of his place when he was attacked to near death. The situation forced the younger son to take the whole control while he was not interested in his family business. Thus, the movie deals with how the youngest son transforms from a good guy to a ruthless mafia kingpin."

A godfather who cares about those around him, sometimes does justice to them, his family does not care about him, and he does not use his influence to trade drugs and pays for it! Of course, apart from the differences between Michael Corleone and Vito Corleone, the film finally comes to the point that when the mafia, and business and work take precedence over the family, you will kill people in the general way and have to commit crimes. Who knows, maybe the world of politics is the same, with the difference that there is no escape from it ..."

Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),baydog63,10,2 January 2006,"I remember seeing this as an 8 or 9 year old kid with a friend of mine when it first came out(with no parental guidance, the manager of the theatre never enforced the rating system). You would think a 8 or 9 year kid at the time would find the movie long or boring, but quite the opposite, when it had an intermission at the 2 hour mark we was like wow 2 hours has passed!! This is a movie best not watched on TV where there is commercials to interrupt because TV tends to make one's attention span short due to the enormity of other programming to watch.I remember watching it on TV years later and thinking to myself i can see how someone just seeing it for the first time would find it long and boring. The reason being is because if you do not tune on it from the beginning it is not the type of movie that will catch your attention compared to the action adventure blockbuster movies people are use to seeing. For a movie to keep a couple of 8 or 9 year old kids interested for 4 hours it had to done something right.I am not a movie critic so i don't feel comfortable rating it but to this day it is one of the few movies i can clearly recall almost every scene as compared to other movies where i just have a vague recollection of what they were about and what happened when and where.One reason i think i enjoyed it so much as a kid was because the story was interesting. A mafia kingpin trying to survive gang-wars and treachery.He realizes it is not good profession or lifestyle to have so he tried to steer his son Michael into a peaceful legitimate respectable profession. He tries to explain to Michael the reasons he turned to this lifestyle is because he didn't have access to the educational opportunities Michael had access to. With a wife and many children to feed and jobs very scarce he had to do what was necessary so his family could eat and survive. He knew that Sonny's temperament would not allow Sonny to change course from the family's profession and Fredo so much a nincompoop that Fredo could not have too much responsibility or pressure thrust on him and would need someone to look after him so he kinda was treated like the women of the family. But he saw in Michael intelligence and ability, and he wanted Michael to use his talents legitimately and achieve the American Dream. Sorta what every father wishes for their sons. I think the turning point for Michael from turning from the American Dream was when the police under McCluskey instead of normally taking a neutral role in the war between the gangs took an active role in protecting Sollozo and trying to rid Don Vito of any bodyguards at the Hospital so the allied Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia camp could finish Don Vito off. When Michael was roughed up by McCluskey and the police he began to see the American Dream as a big corrupt hypocrisy and that money and the access to money was the only thing that really mattered in America. Recall the speech he gave to Mary Kay when he told her she was the one who was really naive not him ( It may have been in The Godfather part 2).From that point on Michael began see the irony and erroneous assertions of what his dad was saying that politicians and police would desert him if he would began to expand into narcotics but the exact opposite was happening with the opposing Sollozo-Barzini-Tattaglia faction as their Consigliere Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall) predicted. Sollozo was virtually untouchable because he had Police protection because of the wealth he accumulated from his narcotic operations.As a result Michael lost all his idealism and became a pragmatist. Why try to become legitimate and respectable when no one really is and the so called legitimate and respectable people behind closed doors sell out to the highest bidders regardless whether or not if they are ruthless killers, murderers and worst scum of society.You can transform into being respectable and legit once you accumulate your wealth. Notice the talk by Michael near the end that they are moving the operations to Las Vegas and going Legit."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),surajlalsaharan,10,28 November 2018,"Picture quality is criminally underrated in this film. The balance between the darkness and light, including it in every scene and the way it was used was absolutely class. The way it depicted it the characters, showing the evil that they possess alongside the good, the way that Coppola wanted was done near to perfection. A risk a lot of directors and producers wouldn't have taken due to the movie picture turning out horribly wrong and then having to re-shoot the whole movie again along with added costs. The way that the movie flowed on the screen was done really well. Went at a slightly methodical pace which was pivotal in telling the story. The scene when Vito speaks to the guy in the opening scene to help his daughter is one for the ages and when Michael kills Sollozo and McClusky in the restaurant in New jersey might be one of the best character changes/breakthroughs ever. To be critical as well of the film, even though the general pace of the film was good to tell the story, the wedding scene went on for a bit too long for my liking, but it's understandable as they had too in order to portray the main characters for the story. A lot of movies have this problem for me, it just seems to be a general thing with films. Alongside that, Diane Keaton really didn't to the character of Kay any justice, her acting being as bad as it was, was magnified due to the great performances put in by Brando (Vito), Pacino (Michael Corleone)), Duvall (Tom Hagen), Caan (Sonny Corleone)), Castellano (Clemenza) and Cazale (Fredo Corleone)."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),montanaromichael,10,17 April 2024,"""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. After a long time of waiting I was able to see this acclaimed film, and I must say that the high ratings I noticed are absolutely not wrong. In this film everything is perfect: the actors are the best point in favor of the film, Marlon Brando among all, incredible. Also Al Pacino, James Caan and everyone else have been excellent in their roles. The characters are iconic, everyone! Starting from Don Vito Corleone, one of the characters I love most in the history of cinema (all due especially from the huge performance of Brando), to Michael Corleone, also excellent. The direction of Coppola is incredible as well as the photography, the film also for this factor has always entertained me while lasting 3 hours, which are not heavy. This last factor, that of rhythm, is mainly due to the excellent plot and the excellent writing made and thought. For the '70s, the quality of the music, like photography, vocal audio and special effects are fantastic. During the movie there is a lot of suspense, especially in the movie end, which is excellent. I loved very much the fact that they wanted to insert strong and touching scenes not limited even to the level of cruelty and topics treated, that are very interesting. The setting is perfect for the genre and the costumes as well. I can't wait to complete the trilogy, I expect a lot after this movie."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lahdenperakalle,10,25 December 2022,"The movie starts when all are at rhe weading, and godfather is reveiving some friendly tasks from his godsons, the movie starts like giving the knowledge in what of respect we should look at godfather, does he like he is not called godfather? No, family and his friends is the most that matters to him. The movie has also great graphics and direction and shooting, and so assuming that alot of money was used to make this film. When godfather died at the end of the movie to some stroke it was sad. But his boy michael continued to carry his legacy as the new don corleone and gave the order to kill other family leaders. I mean it was a legendary movie from the start to the end. And there was a saying ""make him a offer he cant decline"", it was a perfect priscription how these families were working. For example the head of the horse in that movie directors bed when he woke up. And their friend johnny got a actor job in a film. It was a offer he couldnt decline."

I have introduced The Godfather trilogy to my two sons with 9 and 7 yrs old 8 years ago. in the beginning, they understood nothing but captured the main message: The father is a wise and respectable man.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),simon-harris20,9,3 November 2012,"This is a masterpiece of modern film-making. Coppola has managed to make his audience care about a Mafia crime dynasty, as we follow the inevitable transition of power from the venerable Don Vito Corleone (Brando) to the youngest of his three sons Michael (Pacino). This was something that the ageing Don never wanted for Michael, wanting to see him legitimised as a Senator or a Governor, but fate and the violent nature of their chosen profession steps in. Impulsive and violent eldest son Sonny (Caan) is duped and gunned down in a drug war, and middle son Fredo is overlooked as he is just not Don material. Michael, however, is his father's son, and his path into the family business is partially forced on him after an attempt on his father's life. Humiliated and beaten by the New York Chief of Police (who is in the pocket of a rival mafia Family), his life changes when he makes a character defining decision to take revenge on both the Police Chief and a rival narcotics trafficker named Sollozo, who, having made the attempt on the Don's life, must now see it through or forever be a marked man. Michael completes the task with a steely eyed determination, and murders both men in a chilling scene in a family restaurant. Michael is then forced to flee the USA to hide in Sicliy under the protection of a friendly Mafia family. His character is further developed after he falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian peasant girl, who is mistakenly murdered when his enemies track him down to Sicily. When Michael returns to America, he is not the same man that sat in his sister's wedding celebration at the start of the movie. He is older, wiser and surrounded as he has been by death and betrayal, those intervening years have been crucial to his character development. Like his father before him, he has chosen his path and has become a Don in waiting. This is an accolade that the older Don Corleone does not wait long to pass on to him, and although the old Don is still alive (surviving the five bullets Sollozo's assassins hit him with) he hands over the reins of power to Michael. Michael, now at the head of the business, accelerates the nefarious activities of the family. He seeks to relocate them to Nevada, but must tie up his New York business, split his territory between his Lieutenants Tessio and Clemenza fairly and settle old scores first. He uses his father as Consigliari, and Tom Hagen, the Families lawyer and Consigliari is quickly sidelined both because, as Michael tells him, he is not a wartime Consigliari, and because he needs his hands clean after the family re-settle in Nevada. The Assassination / Baptism scene is unparallelled, as Michael cuts down his enemies with a ruthlessness that maybe even the old Don did not possess, perhaps the reason why he stepped aside. These scenes are an interlinked series of brutal murders as Michael wipes the slate clean and assassinates anyone and everyone who have opposed the family. The genius is that the murders are interspersed with cutbacks to Michael standing as Godfather to his sister Connie's child, in Church, renouncing evil and Satan, as his Capo's and button men rampage through the remaining heads of the other five families. It is truly breathtaking film making. There has never been a better or stronger collection of actors ever assembled for any film before or since, and the dialogue is as memorable as anything ever committed to the page. There are no weak spots in this movie and the point to consider is that even though this is a film made against the background of crime and violence, and these play a huge part in what unfolds, it is essentially a film about family and loyalty. When the Corleone's decide to take murderous revenge on the heads of the other families, you do not turn from the screen at the savagery which is undoubtedly there to be seen, but instead, you root for Michael to be successful. There are simply too many memorable scenes to recount, but the final scene played out immediately after Michael orders that a Doctor be called for Connie because she is quite rightly hysterical (he has had her husband Carlo garroted out of revenge for Sonny's death) where Kay watches Michael's Capo's pay homage to him by kissing his hand/ring, while his Chief assassin, Neri slowly and deliberately closes the door in her face is the best ending in cinema history. I will end by stating that the Godfather II, is, if it were possible, even better. You will not regret watching this movie. It will stay with you for a long time after the final credits have rolled."

Of Course but once I got older I understood that was a dangerous life but still admired these guys because yes it was a movie but it was someone's real life also. Almost a bio pic if you will. Amazing movie about the mob, loyal, money, power, family & Respect. The Godfather is one of those all time classics. It almost timeless. This movie was the start of it all. It was eye opening to see how mobsters operated, and the crazy life they lived. I believe this movie is the closest to the real thing you can get."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),haizel,,6 June 2001,The Godfather is an excellent movie for: 1.- The Actors 2.- The Director 3.- The Music (in my opinion a magic soundtrack) In conclusion the best film about gangsters in the history (although the Second part don't is least)
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bill-247,,6 December 1998,"Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" is an excellent, epic story in the life of an organized crime family.  Marlon Brando plays Vito Corleone, the head of the family, with such brilliance that we forget ""it is Brando who is portraying Vito!""  As the film progresses, Vito is critically wounded in a mob hit. Eventually, his son, Michael (Al Pacino), assumes control of the family business.  The movie is so authentic in how it relates to the mafia that we, as the viewer, feel as if we are eavesdropping into the lives of a ""real"" mob family.  The film made stars of Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and James Caan. Francis Coppola directs magnificently and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stardust106,,21 May 2004,"What makes for a good movie?  What elements do audiences look for in order to leave the theater sighing `that movie was great?'  To some, it's whether a character goes through a transformation, whether you can literally see a character evolve from one form to the next.  The Godfather is one such movie.  True, on the exterior what you see is a mafia family caught up in the new business of drug dealing and how they deal with a near fatal hit to `The Godfather' himself.   But if you take a second look, what you really see is the struggle between good and evil that one son must face upon the his return to the family home. 	When the movie opens, the audience is introduced to the character of Michael Corleone as played by the great Al Pacino.  Michael is what one would call a `golden child,' everyone in the family had high hopes for him.  They wanted him to become something great, and not get caught up in the family `business.'  In the beginning, he was something great, he was a war hero, returning home for a wedding.  Things take a toll for the worst when Michael's father, Don Vito played by Marlon Brando, is critically wounded during a mob hit.  At this point, the viewer starts to see a change in Pacino's character.  Putting family before all else, Michael gets sucked in to the `business,' seeking vengeance for his father. 	 Throughout the movie, Pacino's character transforms.  He makes the change from a flat character to a round in a very believably way thanks to the direction of Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo.  The elements in the story of The Godfather support Pacino's change so that it's not out of the blue.  In that way, the audience can relate to the story better and even start to feel sorry for the mafia clan known as the Corleones, maybe even start to root for the bad guy, in hopes that the family can come out on top. The Godfather is a great movie, a must see, definitely an 11 on the 10 point scale."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),todd_4560,,1 August 2011,Yes its a guy line and this is by far the greatest guy movie ever made. Any man who has watched The Godfather knows how much this movie would have touched him and his soul. He would have felt like going into a parallel universe and coming out refined. Such is the sheer magnitude and power this movie commands. A long story about one great gangster is not a story about a gangster itself. It is the story of every human that you see in the world everyday or every father you see everyday. It is a story of a father who is trying to pass on his legacy to this sons and as always there will be a son who will want to make it on his own. But there comes a time when the son will realize that family comes first.

I absolutely would love if this was only two hours and not three, I think it gave enough detail on what's happening of the dynasty. Marlon Brando was very much excellent at playing as the Godfather. I loved his quote ""I'll make an offer that you can't refuse"", it sounds class and like a boss. He's such a serious legend like, he actually does look pretty young to play as the Godfather, especially all the make - up and other stuff that had to be put on his face.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),meggs212,,21 May 2004,"The Godfather, which hit movie theatres and wowed audiences over 30 years ago, is still arguably one of the best movies ever made.  Only the best writers, directors and actors could make a story about the mafia, who in the beginning seem to be cold, ruthless killers, and turn it into a group of people winning over the sympathy of nearly everyone in the audience.  This film wouldn't have been as believable or worth watching if it weren't for the great cast.  Their acting drew people into the movie.  Marlon Brando, who played Don Vito Corleone, was introduced to the audience as the Godfather', the leader of the organized crime family.  I loved how he was portrayed as an intimidating leader, but had a softer side for his grandchildren and his son, Michael, who he had a close relationship with. Throughout the movie, negotiations are made, bold-faced lies are told, families are torn apart, and several people are killed.  At the beginning of the movie, the viewer feels sympathy for Michael Corleone because he seems confused and not sure if he wants to join the business.  He makes up his mind to be apart of the business that will soon consume his life and because of that he changes as a person and the viewer no longer seems to identify with Michael and they feel a little bitter towards him.  He looses respect from the audience.  The camera angles added more attitude to the movie, giving it more symbolism. Sometimes the viewer is frustrated with the actors, knowing that if they had just made a different choice, things would have turned out the way the viewer wanted them to.  That's another thing that caught my attention during this film; I found myself upset with the characters and disappointed in them as if they were actual people.  I think that is a great quality in a movie.   I really liked how the viewer's feelings for Michael changed in the end.  It's a nice surprise when movies throw something like that in to spice things up and make the audience hope for a sequel."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rabbit-35,,17 April 2000,"The Golden Era of Hollywood in the late sixties and early seventies produced unbelievable work, but there are a handful of films here that set a different standard for masterpiece. Why The Godfather is at the top of them I do not know, but it definitely reaches out and pulls you in that direction. In its company are perhaps only four pictures: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 2001, Midnight Cowboy, and Chinatown. The only actor left out of this realm is De Niro, and if you include Taxi Driver, you have to mention Dog Day Afternoon, A  Clockwork Orange, Don't Look Now and Apocalypse Now- all bonafide masterpieces, but missing something in the breath of the first five. (Let's not forget where film here created myths on a par with all the greats of cultures old: Star Wars (and bringing to life the definitive one, Excalibar).  Shall we not forget The Graduate?  Two words: The Godfather!"

Jewels handcrafted with this much care are seldom made anymore. But even if they still were the order of the day, it would be truly hard to recapture something this revolutionary."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bnijgomez,,1 October 2012,"The Godfather is a 1972 gangster film by Francis Ford Coppola that portrays the life of a family outsider who becomes a merciless head of one of New York's most dominant Mafia families: the Corleone's. Along with the Corleone's come four other rival and ally families striving to become the underground kings of New York in the late 1940's early 1950's. They fight for their power, respect, and pride as they interact with each other. The five families are the Corleone's, the Tallaglia's, the Barzini's, the Cueneo's, and the Stracci's. The families all have their sole leaders who are addressed as Dons. The Dons are Vito Corleone, Philip Tattaglia, Emilio Barzini, Ottilio Cueno, and Anthony Stracci. Throughout the film the Dons of each family gather together to discuss and try to resolve any differences they may have. In one scene, Jack Woltz, a studio head who did not comply, wakes up to find the head of his prized horse in bed with him. The horse head symbolizes the power they have and how easily they can kill. Another scene involves a dead fish wrapped in a vest to symbolize that the dead character ""sleeps with the fishes"". The fact that they use animals is symbolic. The families may have on-going conflicts but at the meetings there seems to be an established peace treaty. Despite there being four other Dons they all seem to look at Don Corleone as the most powerful. The Corleone family is a well-established one. They are very family oriented for the most part. The family consists of Vito, Sonny, Fredo, Michael, Carmela, Connie, Apollnia, Kay, and Sandra. The Corleone has very close allies including Pete Clemenza, Luca Brasi, and Tom Hagen; Vito's legal adviser. Don Vito Corleone is the main character in this film. He works hard to maintain the status of his family as an organized one. Although he is a crime boss he tries to have legitimate reasons for his actions. Don Vito is a high ranked man in Little Italy, New York. He has many connections and is always finding ways to build upon his empire and also giving back to the community. Don Corleone offers protection to many of the business owners in exchange for their loyalty and services. Since he is so powerful the other four Dons look to him as a growing threat. In the streets of Little Italy, there is an on-going crime war for territory, property, drugs, and all out power. The Corleone house is the family's protected safe haven where most of the movie's important sequences and dialogues are shown. The film takes a turn when Don Vito is severely injured and hospitalized. Control of the Corleone family is up for grabs so Sonny steps in as Don. Sonny is later set-up and killed. His death causes a stir between Don Vito and the other families. Sonny's character is the ""shoot first, ask later"" type of guy so when labeled Don, he immediately took action. Sonny and most of the other Dons, like most men, can't help but try to take on the role as an alpha male. Michael's character starts off as shy but eventually grows to learn the family business. Don Vito does not intend for his son Michael to join in the family business. Don Vito has surrounded himself is crime and wants a better life for his son. When Michael realizes his brother Fredo is too weak to be in charge, he takes control. Michael is a very intelligent man who understands he must pick up right where his father left off because in Mafia's, one mistake can lead to your family's demise. Though the film is about different Mafia families, the violence throughout the movie plays a very small role in the bigger picture. The ""rise to power"" cliché is about having the most allies and maintaining power through fear, not the actual action of killing. Michael's rise to power comes at a higher cost. It takes the deaths of his older brother, family enforcer, and wife for him to realize that he was meant for that lifestyle. If none of those deaths had occurred then Michael and his wife Kay would not be dragged into their new roles as a Don and his wife. Michael's first hit was sloppy but then Copalla makes it so that as Don, Michael's hits go smoothly. This makes it seem like the title Don matures Michael in a sense. The death of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and the birth of his son, Anthony Corleone, symbolizes new beginnings for the Corleone family. At the end of the film, Michael is questioned by his wife about the death of his brother-in-law. Michael denies any involvement and his wife accepts his answer, he is then addressed as Don Corleone by his capos. When one door closes, another usually opens."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rvanscotter,,6 June 2016,Great action. Wonderful production design Amazing Wardrobe Locations are the best Acting is tremendous Great action. This is simply one of the best mob movies ever produced by Hollywood. It travels across the world and still manages to stay focused on the core elements of top notch story telling. The actors go above and beyond what is required to deliver a performance that is regarded as one of the ultimate benchmarks in film history. Film schools across the globe use this film as a benchmark but it could benefit from modern day film technology such as drones and 8k digital film cameras. I'm sure a remake of this movie is right the the corner.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),maricruzdominguez,,3 August 2017,Amazing movie ... true classic. Al Pacino no does an outstanding job. Would recommend watching this trilogy . The cast is amazing . Shows a glimpse of of old new York gangsters. All three movies are must sees . Thee second might even be better than the first. Shows true meaning of family . I remember watching these movies with my father he was a huge fan
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),GGmarsalla4,,4 July 2001,without question the greatest movie ever made every actor/actress in this movie is fantastic James Caan is a master with his part. Talia shire is a great actress and she proves it here there is not enough awards to give out.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aysanserkan,,8 July 2021,"I agree, it's not a movie that everyone will like. But it is a movie that fans will really like."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),IlovemoviesIlovemovies,,9 November 2021,Best movie ever I like it more than the shawshank redemption. This movie should be number 1. The movie is based on a stephen king novel about a man sent to prison in 1949 and forming a friendship with a man there.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jlb628-676-796425,,4 May 2013,"This movie was the biggest let down of my life. From all of the hype and clout that comes with any conversation that involves ""The Godfather"", I was expecting some real action, from beginning to end, but instead Coppola uses only a few powerful scenes of violence to break up all of the dialogue used to explain what is going on, and the extremely exaggerated editing that adds about an hour and a half of unneeded movie time, which really took me away from the storyline. Not only was this movie to slow, but the writing I think could have been better. From viewing this movie once, I did not get that it was a story about Michael Corleone, it seemed more like a movie composed of typical situations in which gangsters of organized crime historically endured. Nonetheless, this movie was photographed beautifully and that is one thing I can't take away from this disappointment of a movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),awaisraza_official,,24 January 2022,"I have seen many amazing movies for many years, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many details and scenes that I cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),adrianattard,,15 November 2004,"The Godfather is the pinnacle of American Mafia in Hollywood cinematics. Besides the more than obvious storyboard of this trilogy, the godfather is filled with references to the roots of the Mafia as a criminal organisation. The opening scene of the trilogy is a beautiful display of limbo lighting and chiaroscuro effect where our attention is focused on Bounasera and Don Vito Corleone. Through the opening conversations we begin to understand the mafia's role in society; to intervene and arrange the clockwork of society when the governmental institutions have failed. We see that the underworld is a male- orientated place. There is an obvious division between work and family which is echoed through the partition between the dark and gloomy office and the bright colourful and chaotic festivities outside. Strangely enough aesthetic perfection is present in the darker realm of Don Vito's office. This hints at the suggestion that the Mafia is merely the evolution of human necessity to arrange what the judicial services can't. Throughout the films we see the Mafia is a family centric 'Business' which revolves around the paterfamilias, i.e. the head of the family. Whatever he sees just and right, all his family follow his wishes, even if they don't agree. If they don't they are aware they will suffer the consequences. The family structure is also present from the Don ,il capo to the consiglieri and further down to the henchmen. There is also a clear picture of inter winding network between the families. In the end it is obvious that when the family tries to legitimize itself it finds great difficult since the Mafia is a cycle; you enter by blood and you part by blood. The Mafia will always be present in American and Italian Society, the only question is how much shall there presence be felt?"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),John_Q_Citizen,,9 November 2006,"I must admit that I wasn't born during the time that this film hit theaters. So consequentially, it probably doesn't have the same impact on me as it did to others from that period."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),salsaridone,,6 August 2021,The Godfather is the best trilogy movies I've ever watched.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kokkinoskhioni,,4 July 2002,"After seeing the first two Godfather movies again, I'm reminded how much their success is to the eternal credit of cinematographer Gordon Willis (and the production designer & actors), and how much the great fraud of Francis Coppola being a talent is held up entirely by his collaboration with people like Willis, Vittorio Storaro and Haskel Wexler in the 70's and early 80's. For all those people out there who still think that The Godfathers are the greatest movies ever, just remember to give credit where credit is due."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),h-h-k,,1 December 2018,"Parents need to know that this movie contains graphic violence. There are machine gun killings, brutal beatings, betrayals, blood. The murders are not unnecessarily gory or lengthy, but their startling abruptness and the expressions of horror on the victims' faces make these images unforgettable. The violence always has gravity. There is brief nudity and sex, and a few curse words. Children too young to see the violence in this film wouldn't be able to appreciate the intricacies of the plot and so would have no interest in the movie."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),endsall,,20 October 2004,"Well, I just wanted to remark on the Sicily scenes. They were superb! Coppola could not have painted a better portrait of the community life in Sicily on those days. I feel I can tell better because I live in Malta, a small island just beneath Sicily which till the late 1970s still had a lifestyle almost identical to that of the Sicilians. The attire, the environment (the fields, the terraced walls, the type of plants), the surroundings, the wine bars, the facial characteristics of the people were very much similar to those of the Maltese people and in some places it is still very similar to that. And this culminates in the wedding celebrations. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Imboredagain719,,20 May 2004,"There's a bond that family members have between one another. It's something unexplainable. In most cases, they are there for you whenever you need them most. Maybe it's a loan you need help paying off. Maybe there is a boy at school that has been giving you a hard time, your big brother will be there right be your side. The movie ""The Godfather"" shows this bond between family members, but the movie shows it at it's most extreme. 	The definition of a Godfather is ""a man that sponsors a person at baptism"". Another definition is ""to take under one's fostering care"". The slang term for ""Godfather"" is of course, ""the leader of and organized crime family"". It's amazing how this movie incorporates all three of those definitions."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iammahmoudbadawy,,25 August 2020,I consider this masterpiece with all the life issues and attitudes within it is a way to understand and deal with life but you have to look with more attention.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),marykateandashleyarebeautiful415,,16 May 2004,"The Godfather was a wonderfully done movie. This movie had comedy, romance, death, family. The movie begins with the lead Godfather, Don Vito Corleone and his daughters wedding. This means in ritual that anyone may come to the Godfather asking for a favor. Whether someone needs to be killed, or something needs to happen in order for that person to succeed. This movie revolves around Mafia people, such as the other leaders in the mafia besides Don Vito. Now after his daughters wedding day he is already processing these favors that people have asked of him. As the movie progresses Don Vito gets shot, but to the peoples dismay he survives. Though he is no longer a threat to the other Mafia Leaders. Then after a few other mishaps Don Vito's son Michael turns the tables as he begins the process of becoming the Godfather. Once this happens, Michael handles what he needs too and then the film ends. I know that the reason this movie ended this way was because there was eventually going to be a sequel. I personally enjoyed this movie, it sucks you in like a twister. It just has this part that keeps your curiosity button going. I know this, as I started this movie not wanting to watch and after the first hour I was hooked. Now I will most likely go out and rent the others to see if this extremely sensational classic can be out done. I know that if this movie did not have as much romance, death, or family values then it would of not been appealing to me. I recommend this movie, it in a way shows that the little man can become more then you ever thought."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),vivianla,,13 June 2021,"Story was amazing. Don is the Grandfather and it is his daughter's wedding. His son Michael went from being scared to fire a gun to taking over the family business. We watch him hide out in Italy after killing the two men who shot at the Grandfather five times. He meets a girl and he is struck by her beauty. He talks with a local and the local is closed off after realizing it is his daughter he likes. They end up getting married after the father is given an explanation that Michael wants to marry his daughter. Just a warning, there is a nude scene where the Apollonia shows her breasts to her new husband. She ends up dying as she is in a car and it blows up, targeting Michael. Michael returns to the US and goes to meet his past lover named Kay. They end up together and have a son. While playing with Michael's son, the Grandfather faints and dies in the garden. They hold a funeral and Michael is now the head. He ends up killing everyone who are the family's enemies and his sister's husband. We see two men come in to shake hands and greet him as Don, despite Don having died."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fjustice1988,,20 October 2002,"I'm not saying it's my favorite film, THE SHINING is my favorite movie of all time, but I have to say: this has to be the greatest movie ever made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),animtakitahamid,,24 July 2020,"The great movie i have ever seen.
Al Pacino acting was great."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sehguhc19,,7 April 2001,"`Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man,' remarked Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando. By reading that quote, one might have thought that Vito was a virtuous and wonderful family man. However, he was the Godfather to the most powerful crime family in New York who dealt with murder every day. Little by little throughout the film, the viewer easily bought into the myth of the mafia: the family togetherness and their rich traditional background. But, director Francis Ford Coppola also exposed the viewer to what actually goes on in the mafia: death, blood, and calculated murders. Coppola used the elements such as camera angles, lighting, editing and dialogue to compare and contrast the myth versus the reality if the mafia in the scenes in the film, which were the events during Connie Corleone's (Talia Shire) wedding, the baptism of her child and the confrontation between Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his abusive brother-in-law, Carlo (Gianni Russo). Before the Corleone family lures the viewer in, they should take into consideration what is actually going on. 	"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cristialex-54193,,19 December 2018,"I havemt acutally seen the movie, but i heard its preety good, definitely worth a watch"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fexux-01725,,5 September 2017,"The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Blondi85,,27 May 2004,"The Godfather is absolutely the best movie of all times. It is a true classic that will always be a great film for every generation. This movie will still be great in 50 years. The Godfather is about the Italian mafia and all the work they do. The Godfather (Don Vito Corleone) is the leader of the mob. Most of his sons are in the family business except for his son Michael, played by Al Pacino. He gets involved later. The acting was truly amazing in this film. Marlon Brando did great playing the Godfather and doing that famous voice that you will recognize watching the film even if you have not seen it before. Al Pacino did an incredible job portraying his character. Every actor was perfect in this film. Each actor brought something to the film and they were all needed to make this movie such a great movie. The screenplay was remarkable. The storyline never got boring. It is also very ingenious, because you can watch this film 10 times and still find something new that happened in the plot. Things will make even more sense when watching the film again. There is so much depth to this story."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mohanmaggo,,26 September 2019,"This movie is such a masterpiece, an extremely best example for all cinema lovers and aspiring filmmakers. The cinematography is as best as today's generation movie. This movie is prove it self to a mile stone in the history of world cinema."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),a_you-33422,,8 May 2017,I just watched this movie for the first time and I didn't find anything special about this movie. In my opinion we shouldn't call a movie a good movie just because of famous actors or actresses. Maybe in 70s there were not good movies and this one was considered a good one! Anyway I personally didn't like it at all.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),absacc,,15 January 2021,"I enjoy it, it is the best movie in the world, i like it , I love it"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),andreas-09996,,31 August 2016,"It is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews make sure that it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy because I did think that it was a good film but that was really it I wouldn't call it the 'best movie ever' it was worth watching and I do think that everybody should watch it at least once in their lives but that is really it. I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping. It has good acting, nonetheless, and outstanding directing. But after you've succumb to its somewhat impressive acting and directing, you'll realise it's merely a boring film with slow scenes that are difficult to draw you in. However slow paced it was it did show a good representation of mobs in the time period because it was mostly dialogue instead of the gun heavy gangsters most people will think of when they think about gangsters and the mob it is really about family, loyalty, greed and relationships and this is all shown very well specifically Michael arc where he started of not wanting to be part of the family business but later on takes command and becomes the voice of the family and this shows loyalty to his family and he does have a few problems with relationships when he has to leave one women he loves to go into hiding and then his next love is blown up in their car so he doesn't really have the best relationships and this development of the character is the reason he was my favourite character throughout the film I give praise to Marlon Brando and Al Pacino for their extremely grasping roles there are many fantastic things about the film such as the street fight and the iconic dialogue like ""sleeping with fishes"" and ""it's not personal only business"", but that being said, there are many other things I find boring, slow, and inpatient about it such as the opening scene of the wedding which I thought that it went on for longer that it needed to. However, it is a good film, overall. Just too overrated is all. Considering all this I would rate this a 6 or 7 out of 10."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),J.A.G.,,14 May 1999,"This movie is excellent.  The only reason it's not my favorite movie is it's not that pleasant to watch.  In my opinion, The Godfather, Part II ALMOST matches this.  What puts Part I over the top for me is Marlon Brando.  He is unbelievable.  Also, Al Pacino's performance was Oscar worthy (correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he won).  His transformation was unforgettable. Overall, see this and the sequel, but skip part III."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),abdullahsk-70934,,28 March 2018,"I have watched this movie for 3 times

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),parsina_AFC,,10 April 2023,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stacy-39915,,6 June 2017,I love this movie and it was definitely an eye opener for me. The greatest movie of all time in my opinion. I have all the collections and I watch it everyday. If you are into murder and trader this is definitely the movie for you. I think everybody should watch this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),onursivrihisar,,6 November 2017,The key scene for understanding Michael is the baby's baptism; watch the juxtaposition of the images with the words the priest is saying. As he renounces Satan he performs the very actions he is renouncing. Coppola was so good at using images to contradict words; it is really his signature. Pacino becomes the very image of Satan as he murders all those people while standing reciting the holy words of baptism renouncing the very deeds as he is performing them. What a work of art!! Only Francis Coppola could do this.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nonomkay,,5 July 2017,"The book was an excellently written piece, and the film most definitely does it justice. With a star studded cast, a strong plot behind it, and great videography this film has secured its place in Americas film hall of fame."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),bonjamin,,31 October 2001,"Unarguabaly Coppolas finest work The Godfather centres on the corleone family's rise and near fall in 1940s gangland America.With the retirement of Vito Coleone(brando) and death of his thuggish succesor Sonny corleone(caan).Michael corleone(pacino) clean cut college boy previosly uninvolved in the family business makes the transition to cool,cold and ruthless don(head of the family).Following a series of deaths and betrayels Michael does away with all opposition to secure the family's place in power. Featuring some of the most intelligent and brutally executed death scenes ever filmed and the finest actors in the business the film is not just a hugely entertaining epic. The godfather deals with many themes such as power,violence,rites of passage,love and betrayel.With a fantastic score, great direction and fine assembled cast there is nothing i can think of to critisise the film. Be prepared for part two"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),srubia,,10 November 2000,"... when so many people complain about an all-time classic like ""The Godfather"" being too long and slow.  I'm a firm believer that a movie needs to be as long as the story allows; we don't need to make a SNL skit into a 90-minute movie, and we don't need to cut a novelized classic down to placate the dwindling attention span of the audience.  What scenes would you cut, honestly?  What is not needed in this movie?  Would you shorten the long shot of Michael as he admits that the Turk needs to be killed?  Maybe cut out the Don's death scene, as it obviously slows down the movie? Honestly, I don't understand it..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),malixeagle,,14 March 2016,One of the best movies I have seen from Hollywood.

Interstingly i have found a better platform for movie buffs like me through www.flickstree.com,in which one can stream,write and also rate a movie and it is highly recommended"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),aliqaryan,,26 January 2018,The Best movie ever. I'm still enjoying watch it again.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),halodude-91048,,25 May 2015,"Why did I give the Godfather an 8/10 instead of a perfect score like so many? 8/10 is still a good score in my book, but why couldn't I award those two extra stars. It's considered by almost all to be a three hour masterpiece. But, there's my first problem. It's three hours. Not that I despise movies that run for this long, because some certainly do have the content to keep that run time entertaining. This one, however, gets boring and slow at times. When I say this, I am mostly referring to the Marlon Brando dialogue scenes. I cannot get over the way the words fall out of his mouth as he mumbles them. Why he did his dialogue like this, I have no idea. If there was a reason for it, I stand by my rating. Don't get me wrong, this movie was anchored by great performances and writing, directing and cinematography, but it did not require three hours to be told. Many call it a masterpiece, I call it a good film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Cwoods04,,17 May 2004,"The Director of the drama hit `The Godfather' Francis Ford Coppola, was unique at directing this film. There seem to be a lot of transitions in this film and mystery. He also was sneaky at who is the real main character."

A must see"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ogradyfamily,,30 August 2002,"The Godfather, released in 1972, is still the basic guideline for any other mafia movie or any other movie released since. The acting from Al Pincho, James Cann, and Marlon Brando are some of the best acting I've seen since Citizen Kane and The Big Sleep. This movie deserves to be on be the number one movie at imdb.com and is number one in my book for favorite movie of all time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sebaveron2001,,2 February 2004,"the film that made Marlon Brando more famous than ever, the Mob Epic of all Mob Epics starring one of the greatest casts of all time, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton etc.  A longer than 3 hour mobster drama that every adult who is worth knowing will have seen, a piece of genius to end all mob genius.  I can't praise it enough!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),balthzar,,2 July 1999,"If you haven't seen this movie, then you're missing a part of American history. Open your eyes to one man's struggle against the many, while he tries to keep his family and a promise to his father. If you have a close relationship with your father I highly recommend this film. If you don't, I highly recommend this film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sharathbabu,,24 October 2016,"As opposed to focusing on everything that is incredible about The Godfather, a much simpler route for me to judge its quality is on what is terrible about it. Practically every film has something that I don't care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldn't transform anything about The Godfather. There is nothing feeble about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),hhcquan1_dp,,16 June 2022,"Hhcquan1_dp: A classic work, no matter how long, it always deserves to be the ""godfather"" of the world literature village. Hopefully world literature will have many such good works."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),psivaji,,21 June 2000,"The acting, directing, and script of The Godfather was excellent and beyond reproach. I cannot think of another movie (esp. one that was 3 hrs.) that captivated me and kept me glued to the screen from start to finish."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),searchanddestroy-1,,30 December 2022,"There will be a before and after THE GODFATHER in the movie history, and I will also say in the real life Mafia, Cosa Nostra way of life, from the inside. The screenplay was inspired by a nover written by Mario Puzo, himself helped by a very accurate documentation on this sensitive subject. Before THE GODFATHER, there were two awesome films about the true mafia: Richard Wilson's PAY OR DIE and Richard Thorpe's THE BLACK HAND, starring...Gene Kelly. Back to THE GODFATHER, the funniest is that after this movie, the Mafia goons and leaders were hemselves inspired by the film.... It is purely awesome in any sense, from any angle where you can see it. Acting, directing, editing too; and this for both films GODFATHER ONE and TWO. Thousands of films will try to copy it, with more or less success; as there will also thousands of films trying to copy other films - also starring Al Pacino ( what a coincidence) : SCARFACE, HEAT, ....It is brutal, bloody, poignant, even for the most squeamish audience. Anyone can love this film, or at the least appreciate it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Neonsamurai,,26 May 2004,"I've never seen the Godfather before but Richie said he was `tired of watching Snooker Legends' and wanted to watch a proper film. I watched it and thought is was good. The colours weren't as nice as the ones in Prince of Tides' but it was a decent film with a beginning, middle and an end."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jaybabb,,10 March 2004,"The hunter becomes the hunted. Those who live by the sword, have better watch their backs. This is the essence of this film(and the other two as well). In the underworld of the most powerful crime families in the 1940's and 1950's violence begets violence."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Lt_Kilgore,,29 January 2001,"The Godfather is an American classic, because it contains basically everything a great movie needs.  The flawless performances make the movie incredibly realistic, and the cinematography and score make The Godfather even more effective.  Practically everyone who watches it falls under its spell in the first or second viewing.  A film of such power deserves to be considered one of the greats.  However, the trip to Sicily is pointless and time consuming, which takes a point off the grade."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),pramsalim,,24 August 2017,"Yesterday, was the final day of my examination. A day I had been longing for quite some time. My teacher actually gave us an assignment to write an essay about my future career, but school businesses can wait. I got more important stuff to do. I went to my room, flipped open my laptop, and searched for a good movie in Netflix. Something caught my eye as I skimmed through the movie lists. There it was, Marlon Brando's face as the infamous mafia Don. With a vibrant looking rose just pinned in his suit. The Godfather was offering itself to be watched. An offer I can't refuse."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ben_yocom,,8 June 2004,"The God Father Part One is named by this web site to be the greatest movie of all time and for good reason. This movie is a tale of mobsters but as the movie goes on the viewer begins to relate to the mobsters. This movie is a feet of writing, directing, and filming. Music set to this movie fits perfectly to each scene and sets the mood for that scene. This movie has nothing to do with most people's real life instead it has to do with their dreams of wealth and power and is a great movie for any one who has ever dreamed of wealth. 	The main character in this movie evolves from one who is dead set against becoming a member of the family to the head of the family this transition is the focus of the story and is told and shown very well."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nruss78,,5 November 2004,"The plot line of this movie is great. I just watched this movie again and the scenes of Micheal whacking the crooked cop and the other mobster family head and the scene where the director wakes up to find his favorite horse's head and blood all over and beneath his feet still shocks and stuns me... this movie portrayed the drama of it all elegantly and I love every minute of it. Although 2 things are odd... In the beginning when the first Godfather is being begged for help I was surprised that the beggar wasn't killed off then for being so disrespectful to Don Corneioli (I hope that's how it's spelled). I mean this guy is an infamous, murderous mobster who's career started out practically with a murder (As seen in the future Godfather movie) but he'd let someone who left him disrespected alive seems so uncharacteristic of the man. And also the length of the first wedding in the movie, the very first few scenes of this film, well... was horrible, I'll not lie. At the risk of being stoned by those in love with this movie I have to say that they had achieved the desired effect after the first or second deal the Godfather made, not entirely sure which it was since the movie lasted so long but I'm pretty sure not past 2. The rest of it was very nice and all and showed how he did business (bloody and death-ridden beneath a velvety, beautiful cover) but was it really necessary to do so much of it? Would've been just as effective if it had been otherwise than it turned out to be."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),TOT_EchoofGlory,,5 May 2020,"Nearly 50 years later, Godfather is still a movie that audience are interested in. The legendary story background, vivid characters, power struggle between gangs, light, music and lines are all first-class. In video game Mafia, the leading role is also calling Vito. Maybe it's a tribute to Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tlawther,,15 January 2019,"Marlon Brandi was born to play this role, The Don Corleone in the Godfather
It would have been great had he lived longer and could have.reprise somed his role then appeared in the last two movies. The Godfather movie seemed so real it made me feel like I was.there, really.there! I don't know if this movie could be remade,however it might be interesting.for the younger generation to see some of their favorite actors playing in.such iconic roles."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Sorsha-3,,8 March 1999,"Through the years I kept hearing about ""The Godfather"" and how wonderful it was and all of that. I saw the video at the library and finally decided to see what the hype was all about. Am I glad I did! It was one of the best movies I have seen. I stayed up past midnight (which is unusual for me) to watch it because I just couldn't turn it off."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),dandarocker,,19 October 2011,"Many people who watch this film now describe it as boring, drawn out and a great let down. However this is often simply because modern cinema goers expect, lightning fast car chases, huge explosions and enough special effects to make your eyes bleed."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),MA$E,,16 August 1998,"The first time I saw this I was speechless. This is obviously the most excellent film ever. With a near perfect cast. A great Director. The music is one of the best things about it, I love the Godfather song. Almost every scene is unforgettable. A Perfect Film!!!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Shree,,21 August 1999,"THE GODFATHER undoubtedly remains a masterpiece in motion picture production and is probably on the top ten list of best films ever made of most movie buffs.  Based on Mario Puzo's highly acclaimed novel of a fictional Sicilian American crime family, it is a dramatic and realistic portrayal of the trials and tribulations of life, liberty, and justice in the ""underworld"". This film introduced moviegoers to the acting genius of Al Pacino and reemphasized the unique talents of Marlon Brando, which won him an Oscar in his splendid portrayal on Don Vito Corleone, the founder and titular head of a powerful mafia family.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Nuncio,,6 August 1998,"Well, to say something about this movie is rather easy because you know that every single serious movie-goer would agree that this is one (I would say THE ONE) of the best movies ever made in heaven or hell. Then why should I comment on this one? Because this is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE and I want to make that clear...  :)"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Venus-25,,8 August 2001,"There is no praise I can make that has not yet been said here, except that after having read the book in a single sitting I was enraptured by this film. There is no flaw in any frame. The period detail is beautiful and atmospheric, the tension between the actors in preparation for the violent conflicts is contagious, and the intensity of the performances pulls the viewer right into the characters' world. It is easy to understand how the characters in THE SOPRANOS fall in love with this film and want to see themselves in it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Angarita,,7 March 2003,"""The Godfather"" is an exquisite mafia epic which constructs a compelling Italian family saga, with an insight into violence, power, crime, corruption, and honor. ""The Godfather"" (1972) is a superb gangster film, situated in New York in the late 1940s. The family is dominated by the aging Godfather `Don Vito Corleone' (Marlon Brando). There are five Italian American families and `Don Corleone,' is the head of one. The film shows the Italian American families pursuit of profit through corruption and governmental protection. The film's screenplay was based upon Mario Puzo's best selling novel based on the Corleone family. It was about three hours long and had excellent acting, besides beautiful and outstanding photography and choreography. The recreation of the period of time with the ending of World War Two was authentic. ""The Godfather"" opens with a man known as Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) in the dark, then as the light fades in, he is in the home office of the Don Corleone. There he conducts his business while outside in the garden area his daughter's wedding reception is taking place. The Don is accompanied by his overseer known as the consigliore, the legal advisor, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The `Don' promises favors to Sollozzo and expects favors in return. The youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) transforms his shy character into the future `Don' of the family. Michael was influenced to make this decision from the shooting of his father; he felt the family was in need of support. When Michael becomes `Don,' he has taken revenge upon one of the Italian American families, Tattaglia, where he makes an arrangement to meet Bruno Tattaglia (Tony Giorgio) and Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) in an Italian American restaurant planning to kill them. As Don Vito Corleone revives, he tells Michael when he passes on a betrayer working for one of the families will approach him, thus revealing who will betray the Corleone family. Michael arranges a massacre during the baptism of his sister's child for the revenge of his father's shooting. This becomes a major turning point in Michael's life and in the film. His loyalty to the Corleone family is now unquestionable, and his future is sealed. It was a very interesting, emotional, and entertaining film. I was intrigued with the Italian language and culture and the scenery of Italy filmed throughout the movie. The drama was intense and the unexpected movements stirred my imagination. I would recommend this film for viewing for the appropriate adult aged viewer. ""The Godfather"" will always be remembered and go down in film history, especially with the line by Don Vito Corleone, `I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.'"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ifoster,,27 November 2002,"In general, this film portrays the institution that is the crime family. The family is powerful because it is connected, intimidating and brutal. Either you are a friend of the family, or an enemy of the family. If you are a friend of the family, then you are subjugated by the family--you owe the family for being your friend. If you are an enemy of the family, then you are first threatened,and if you are still recalcitrant, then you are killed. (Evidently, the family operates in much the same way as the Roman Empire operated in its hey day.) Respecting everyone with whom you are involved and playing by the rules of the game are necessary virtues during times of peace and breaking them is a virtue during times of war. Because the aesthetic of this crime world is understandable to the viewer, the brutality that permeates it is palatable to the viewer."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),RoboGarrett,,7 June 2020,"This movie really is at or near ""perfect"" level filmmaking. The writing, directing and especially acting are all superb. What a great cast, what a great story (based on a great novel by Puzo)... no matter how many times I watch it, I never get tired of The Godfather."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),russnickm,,30 June 2003,"Last Thanksgiving the WHOLE family was sitting at the table, eating, drinking.  My cousin shouted in from the living room, ""The Godfather's on,"" and it was, on regular TV complete with edits and commercials.  Anyway, it's safe to say that every person in that house that day saw The Godfather a hundred times and the comments were, ""My God, I've seen that so many times...""  and within ten minutes everyone was in the living room, holding dishes in their hand, eating standing up, watching this movie that everyone knew inside out, everyone quoting from the movie as the actor's spoke, and so on.  Trivia facts shared, general info on the movie, and EVERYONE glued to the picture.   THAT is the sign of a great movie.  If a movie can hold this kind of hypnotic magic, even  after all these years, it has succeeded in the art of story-telling.  Perhaps no other movie has this attraction like Godfather I.  So, don't feel silly if you are seeing this movie for the tenth time (Or the hundredth time).  It's always a winner."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thuvarakansri,,8 December 2020,Great film that has shaped modern cinema and placed Italian immigrants in America on the map!
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),panic100,,10 April 2003,"I had high expectations for this movie since it's first on imdb and third on AFI's, but I was disappointed. It's not that I don't like Mafia movies, I didn't saw a lot of them but I loved Goodfellas and in my opinion it's a superior movie than this. "

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),AndyPhil647,,14 July 2004,"The Godfather is a masterpiece. The actors are fantastic,(Pacino and Brando in particular), it is well-written and masterfully directed. It probably has more famous lines than any other movie. Every day on T.V. you see something imitating the Godfather. While a lot of people would argue that it doesn't deserve it's #1 ranking, can you think of a better movie? I think the scene in this movie that best explains why this is an excellent movie from every angle is the baptism scene. While all this murder and brutality is going on around him, Michael Corleone is standing godfather to his sister's child. The music is great and you you finally understand what the title of this movie really means."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),behind_a_mirror,,20 May 2004,A man must be with his family. If he is not in contact with his family he is not a man. Problem is the family is part of an organized crime syndicate. Throughout this film by Francis Coppola we get the opportunity to get a slice of pie in this family and time period of Americana.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),rpm-8,,7 July 1999,"I really it hate when I'm flipping with the remote and I come, once again, upon ""The Godfather"".  No, it's not because I'm bored with it after seeing it 1,000 times.  It's because it is still completely captivating and totally enthralling every single time I see it.  And, I can't turn away!  It is and always will be, my favorite movie (along with and equal to Part II).  As others have said, skip Part III.  Or, at least, enjoy it on its own terms and don't try to compare it to or even think of it as a part of a trilogy of Parts I & II. Part III is the ""Let It Be"" album of Francis Ford Coppola. (You Beatles freaks will understand)."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),iceman43,,12 April 2004,"a lot people her bash this movie as being boring.I read their comments and it seems they only like the violent parts cause that's all they could remember. But really the story is about how Mike,a normally nice guy(college boy,apple of his daddies eye)becomes a cold hearted monster this is the tragedy of this story( which is it's greatest asset)I was very engaged by all the characters I even know names and lines of the movie. As a kid I didn't understand it and couldn't watch it and I loved gangster movies. But as I got older I finally understood the movie. The violence only makes the point of Mike's turn even stronger as he shows no remorse for what he has done. In the beginning of the movie he tells Kay the story of Johnny Fontane's contract. But he basically tells her that's how my family operates,not me. Then as the film pushes on he becomes worse then his father ever was because he kills with no remorse and does only what his mind tells him instead of listening to his heart sometimes( classic struggle). In my opinion this is one of the greatest films ever!!!!!!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),randypeterson,,18 June 2002,"First of all, if you watch this movie and don't go ahead and watch The Godfather, Part II, you haven't seen the whole work.  They are a single piece and are best experienced that way.  (If you don't have the six hours to kill, at least view each movie on consecutive nights.)"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cjholland,,3 April 2003,"When a person asks the question, ""What is your favorite movie?"" I hesitate to answer because it has almost become cliche to name Francis Ford Coppola's epic, ""The Godfather.""  However, to name any other film would be a grave injustice to the majestic perfection that is indeed captured in these three hours of artistic achievement.  Instead of referring to the cliche without explanation, I am quick to point out that which makes this film deserving of such accolades:"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),CPAM,,3 June 1999,"The Godfather is an engrossing movie about how one man is slowly drawn into the mob and into a life of crime.  Marlon Brando plays mafia boss Don Vito Corleone who is shot down early in the movie.  The movie then goes on to show how his son, Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, is entangled in the world of crime.  This movie is one of the best ever made and has many scenes that are so complex and thought provoking that it, at times, gives me chills.  The Godfather is a movie that should eventually be seen by everyone and I highly recommend it."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NYcritic2,,17 January 2003,"This is the movie that restored the motion picture business, and it's been an upward move since then.  An epic by all definitions of the word, it displays a wonderful story with wonderful acting, directing, editing art direction and music.  I've seen this movie three times and it holds up."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),doberman101,,3 July 2003,"Godfather is the classic great movie of all time.  It is movie perfection. It is the most incredible masterpiece. Its like watching magic on screen, it like viewing your first baby being born. It flows like butter. it never gets tired, I've watched at least 20 times and I'm still amazed. Infact I might just go watch it right now. You should too and if don't have the Godfather Collection DVD go buy it. And keep it under your pillow when you sleep."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),neale.apps,,8 June 2000,"I saw The Godfather at least seven or eight times before I read the original Mario Puzo novel. While the movie reached me on several levels, I never quite understood why. Then I read the book: I was stunned. I don't know the exact contribution Coppola made to the screenplay (both he and Puzo are credited), but in some scenes the actors were reading Puzo's original lines direct. And with good reason: they simply couldn't be bettered."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lucasbernabe,,15 November 2018,It's an amazing movie. Director was a great artist. A piece of art. Marlon made the best movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kellybee,,8 December 2001,"My six criteria for a ""great"" film:"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Histrymaker,,3 June 2004,This film is truly one of a kind
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),SodaGuy,,11 April 1999,"This was a great film in every sense of the word. I loved it because it was so believable and everything that was done was most likely true. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan were excellent. Brando's voice, Pacino's youthful look, Duvall's innocence, and Caan's brutality all drew me in and it never bored me. In only his third film of his long and brilliant film career, I saw Al Pacino's attitude gradually change for the worst. First we see Pacino the war hero, then as he gets into the Corleone family business he becomes a changed man and starts to gain the right to put his two- sense in. I also saw the innocence of a young looking Robert Duvall that I felt compelling and most interesting to watch. Also, the way that all the scenes of violence were orchestrated I could tell it was accurate or Francis Ford Coppola and the rest of his crew spent time researching the accuracy and made it as close to accurate as possible. Everything about this film was disturbing and that is what made it so darn good because it was so true. As great as the Godfather series of movies were it is my opinion that the first Godfather could have stood on its own without making two more parts. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it. I also plan to rent the following two parts at a later date so I could soak this first part in.  Nine hours of The Godfather is a lot to take in at one time so enjoy this wonderful epic, but over time. My suggestion to people who haven't seen this film is to go and see it because no matter what type of film you enjoy, I guarantee you will like this one."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Bill-308,,31 January 1999,"Back in 1972 I was much too intellectual to be interested in a movie based on a pulp novel. Then I was dragged to see ""The Godfather"" and my outlook on popular entertainment changed forever. If ""The Godfather"" was outstanding, how could ""Godfather II"" be better? I dunno, but it is. The movies spin a tale of family, and they illustrate how the sins of the fathers, even loving fathers, will cast tragedy across the generations. Steer clear of part III, a redundant tale that begged never to be made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),godfathermemer,,30 June 2020,"The Godfather is the pinaccle of flawless films!!! The screenplay, the direction and the acting makes this film flawless."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),armandocorea,,18 November 2017,one of the most beautiful works of art. Francis Ford Coppola surpassed all the boundaries of old cinema and delivered an innovative vision of the Italian mafia showing us the value of loyalty and the pain of betrayal. we can see an incredible version of Marlon Brando as the Godfather and Al Pacino as the son who is confused and we can see him corrupt himself and accept his destiny.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),t-leigh,,24 February 2003,"These words can be heard throughout this movie. So with it can other lines that people love to quote. I guess you could say I love this movie for the way it was written. For that I would say you might as well be right. I mean this is a great film that has been said to be the ""greatest film"" ever made. I don't really know if I can support that. It has been a ""great drama"" but that is just that there are other genres out there you know. One should also be advised that it is four hours long. Given in this day and age who has four hours to sit down and watch a great film much anymore? You know also there was alot of killing and intent to injure others in this film which might make you wonder about today. If i s alright to have in movies but not alright to have in real life? For the love of the great man upstairs its not a kids movie either. It might as well be a movie that you go see after reading the books. Thats right theere is a series of books! I never knew that until I looked on here and saw who wrote the screenplay. May you rest in piece Mr. Puzo you will not be forgotten! Please watch this film give it a chance and remember this, there are books!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fixermorocco,,9 May 2017,"This feature is one of the best! i watched a lot and it is still my favored one. i have to give two thumbs up for the actors and director. my dream is to be able to work on it, if only i was there with the crew preparing sets and interacting with them actors, high people. To me, this film pictured the actual contraband and mafia rules that reigned in the time."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),KoRnNut-2,,9 March 1999,"This is the #8 movie of all time. Classic scene after classic scene. Symphonic violence. Vengeance. Great characters. Characters that despite their violent nature you sympathize with them. You want to be Don Vito Corleone. There's not one flaw in this whole movie. You wish it was even longer. Seeing this as a child I wanted to grow up to be Luca Brasi. All elements of a man's movie can be linked here. Honor, Revenge, Violence, Separation of love and sex, loyalty, omerta, and family. There isn't a single second in this 170 minute movie that drags. There's great dialogue, great scenes, great characters, great acting. It's very difficult to choose among them. My only wish for this movie is that they had filmed more of Luca Brasi. He has plenty more explanation in the book. But all in all this is film making at its very very best. And it's just fun to watch."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),stepanvitecek,,26 August 2019,"Beautiful film, great performances from every actor."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),eduardo-12,,22 March 1999,"I guess it's the fourth time I watch this movie and it seems to be getting better as I watch it again and again. Movies about the mafia are one of my favorites. I just loved The godfellas, Casino, Once Upon a Time in America but The godfather is diferent it not just about mafia. Its about a family completely involved in mafia. As some one have written here, the changes in Michael's ( Al Pacino ) personality are incredible. One of the best part is the baptism. Meanwhile Michael is at the church, his fellows show how will it be to deal with the Corleone's."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),swisener,,10 March 2001,"At the time of its release, this was the best American movie since ""Citizen Kane."" ""Star Wars"" has since exceeded it as a more influential movie, serving as a bridge between ""Kane"" and the future as did ""Kane"" between ""Birth of a Nation"" and the silents. But this is master filmmaking, sure to grip a viewer even on repeated showings."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fod-1,,17 April 2004,"I have to admit, I didnt like this movie at first. At first was when i was about 15 or 16 and didnt really pay attention to any of the dialogue and just waited for something to happen."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),tratext,,10 September 2021,The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ahmedhkamel,,22 January 2020,"The GF movie has been called an American story. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. I appreciating this film."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),NHG-Freeman,,22 March 2003,"This has to be, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. It is pure entertainment and master film-making. Despite its length it maintains interest throughout and, by the end, you're wanting more. POSSIBLE SPOILER! Marlon Brando (Don Corleone) deservedly won the Oscar, with his fine performance. However, because he is absent from a majority of the film, it is the superb support from Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall (who all got Oscar nominations) that really keeps the film at an A-class standard. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER!    The direction of Francis Ford Coppola is practically without fault and so is his writing, also contributed by the author of the novel, Mario Puzo. This is the gangster film that has inspired so many others (including Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and, on TV, ""The Sopranos""). The music and cinematography are outstanding and even the costumes are great. All in all, you can't find a fault with this film. All the elements work and it is just so satisfying. People who think it's over-rated are just fools who couldn't recognize great filmmaking if it hit them in the face. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),philipposx-12290,,11 March 2018,"The Godfather is one of those movies, that will take a straight up evil and bad man and make him look human. Francis Ford Coppola, one of the best directors of all time has created what is now considered the greatest motion picture of all time. Although I prefer ""Psycho"" (1960), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), there isn't much to argue against The Godfather.
It is the pinnacle of flawless storytelling. Seeing how Michael evolves from an innocent young man into the role of the cities biggest Mafia boss, is both gripping and in some ways even fascinating."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),johnny_cocksmoker,,25 August 2003,"If you are a big fan of the HBO TV series the Sopranos, you should check out this movie.  It's not quite the same, the Godfather has more of a straight forward plot, with out the clever twist and turns and various subplot of the Sopranos, but it's still pretty good.  Marlon Brando basically play the Tony Soprano part and I think he's definitely as good as James Gandolfini.  Al Pancio's good in it, too.  This movies is really an under-rated gem, but you should be able to find it at most larger video stores.  You should rent this one for sure.  With that being said, it has a few problems, there's no nudity to speak of in this movie like there is on the Sopranos and while there is a beheading of a horse you don't get to see so much, like when Tony and Christopher cut off Ralphie's head.  Oh, check out the two sequels, they're both alright, too!"
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),thorodinson-50130,,3 January 2022,I re-watch this movie after almost 2 year. While at first time i watch i feel little bored bcz of its slowly build up story. But when plot move forward it became more interesting. Not only me others my friends also felt same. When i watch today i totally enjoy it. I didn't have any words to describe this masterpiece. Amazing casting brilliant actors specially Al Pacino and Marlo Brando. And i alos gonna rewatch its 2nd and 3rd part .

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),newjframe,,14 March 2011,"Today, i have finished watching Godfather 3. After the film, i looked for whom vito carlione was at IMDb so to find out what other films he starred at; yet i saw, it's writing (1924-2004). Eventually, i got very sad. Firsly, i supposed the Godfather film as it is real: so much money property fame murder desire pride, on the other hand see that it's now 2010, and he died in 2004. So there is no sensible relation with the environment, world that i dreamed. He is at the moment accounting for his life, actions which were in this life, this is so much sorrowful that not my eyes but my heart is crying, suffering. How much have i been deceived, made mistake throughout my life. In my mind were some wishes going about, like i wish michael carlione wouldn't have killed his elder brother, at last he himself like his father died on a chair all alone inspite of the trasure, proerty, money, fame. It is so sad inspite of being just a film. I'm not sure if al pacino lives, even he -took a deep breath for sad- Alas me too have died one day all alone, and now i'm asked to account for my life, my actions, my desires. However, i have deceived myself in this deceiving world, shut the sound that tells the truth, the right thing. I have always pursued something seemingly nice but in fact harmful,deceiving as now.As it were, i was the servant, -that is a bit indignity-the dog of this bad sound. Alaaas... Alaaas. What will it help if i were a godfather like don vito carlione or michael. At last, the suffering, very suffering but with the witness of thousands of deads everyday the death, the reckoning after death. I think i have no remedy other than seek forgiveness and help from God, really no remedy else. I always remember the scene that michael was falling and dying on his chair alone, and the sad film music is playing in my mind. Very sad... What remedy else could i have that, now it is really the most important need if anyone has a remedy..."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mrs_ponpuda,,19 September 2011,"That was a classic, this is what you'll hear about this movie. The Godfather has set the stage since it's release in 1972, for all other movies in it's class. All ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have won as many awards. The difference between this movie and the rest is that this film apart has the ability to weave the often-many layers of story into a firm whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, reinforced by so many complimentary themes, each is given added ring. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion. Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. It is obvious that this motion picture was not put together just for the fun of it, to make people laugh; it was carefully crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it. The film opens in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie. The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a Second World War hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their ""adopted"" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man. With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are old fashion. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him. Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be devour by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by betrayed from both within and without. The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from ""innocent"" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was. Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (""A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man"") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""throne"", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son). Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries. Motifs Return to Sicily Michael, Connie, and Kay, all principle characters, are in all three movies, while secondary characters like Archbishop Gliday or Senator Geary appear in only a single film. Of course, such a structure makes sense. The plot follows the most significant characters, while the less significant die or are forgotten. But every rule has its exceptions. In the Godfather trilogy, one such exception is the insignificant, little-known Don Tommasino. Tommasino appears in every movie because he is Vito's and Michael's host and friend in Sicily, the island of Vito's birth to which characters return in every film. In the Godfather films, Don Tommasino may be a minor character, but Sicily is not. Sicily seems to be the mystical place, but in reality, it is a world full of violence and bloodshed. Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are all ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word ""Mafia"" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Harry_Boast,,7 March 2005,"I watched The Godfather for the first time on DVD the other day and was simply blown away from the very start. It had a quality that no other film has and much of this is accomplished by the brilliance of the director, Francis Ford Coppola, and actors Marlon Brando and the astonishing performance of Al Pacino, who many doubted at the time. All great films require a great beginning and this one had, in my opinion, the best yet with the very first line, 'I believe in America', and then the very slow draw back of the camera to reveal The Godfather (Brando). I was worried for Al Pacino at the start of the film whether he would be shadowed out of this movie by the brilliance of Brando, but all doubt quickly went from my mind after watching him in the restaurant scene. The way that he sat there so calmly to the people he was talking to but to the audience he built up an incredible amount of tension. This was important for him to do this because this part of the film was the defining moment of this characters transition, from not wanting to be involved at the start and now he is doing his fathers job personally."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Movieman-133,,26 July 1999,"Well,  what can i say. I rented the Godfather from the library and I completely disliked it.   I gave it an effort but the beginning was so boring that I could bearly tolerate it and I had to take a break from the film.  When I came back I saw people in cars being blown up,   Marlon Brando being injured, an abused wife going crazy with the dishes, Al Pacino young and vengeful  and ,more and more deaths. Big Deal! The people that died were people that were underveloped and I can't say i cared much.  And what's the big fuss about Marlon Brando acting,  he just talked in a funny voice and relaxed-in A Streetcar Named Desire he actually give an effort to act. Well,  i have to admit that I did not finish the film.   It just wasn't fun enough,   not entertaining, and I think the acting nowadays is better.   The part that I shut the film off is when Marlon fell in the garden and the little boy went away.  I then shut it off and said,  that's nice.  If the ending is good then maybe I'll finish watching the Godfather, but i don't know.  It was just not entertaining.  Very boring.   The day before I saw the film I saw the three hour Casino,  which I liked because the music,  the acting, and the excellent 90's pace.   It dealt with the mafia,  Casino,  but people like Sharon Stone and pace made the film emotionally involving.   Watch Casino and then watch The Godfather and ask yourself,    which film was more entertaining?"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ezdub27,,21 May 2004,"The Godfather is arguably the greatest American movie ever made. A film with all the classic movie elements that's perfectly created and executed. Highly regarded by critics and thoroughly studied by film students and movie lovers alike, The Godfather is a masterpiece. It's such a classic that it is still a strong contender in the `Best Movie Ever' debate. 	 	No other movie has told such an involved story of the mafia. Only could a director like Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo, create such an atmosphere of believability. By the end of this epic film, the audience has a newfound respect for some notorious mobsters and unexpected sympathy becomes apparent. Never has such a movie before or since told the story of important values among common criminals so well as here. 	 	Only with fantastic actors could you pull off such a reversal of feelings toward the mafia. Marlon Brando does a fantastic job as the lovable patriarch, whose swollen growl makes him feel like the `Mafia Santa Clause'. The always-good Al Pacino creates a deep character full of turmoil and ultimate greed. His role of Michael, `the heir to the thrown', goes through an extreme transformation of personality and values. Such superb actors like these, and others such as Robert Duvall and James Caan, create an environment full of complex and intriguing characters. 	 	The technical execution of this film is stunning. From the first frame to the end credits, this movie is film production at its finest. Unique and smooth camera movements pair nicely with the story; the score is the quintessential piece to such a gripping plot; and I have never seen a more entertaining murder than in this movie. 	 	A flawless piece of cinema throughout. Great writing, directing and acting make it a classic for the ages. Never have I felt more connected to such ruthless and villainous individuals than in this film. The `climax' of The Godfather sums up all the feelings in the movie: countless murders over the sounds of a child's Catholic Baptism. Outstanding. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),fayruzi,,13 October 1998,"The Godfather is my favorite film of all time. I like all three parts. I like the second one because I like Robert De Niro and I like the first one because Marlon Brando was greater than ever. I like them all because I like Al Pacino. The most ground-breaking about this film is the cinematography. I have to give it to Gordon Willis, he made it look like an epic which it is, the shading, the colors, everything. Mario Puzo is a great storyteller. Coppola is at his finest moments even though his original plans was to make Apocalypse Now'. He gave all his devotion to this picture and it shows. I like that he insisted on his cast, I don't know how it could have been without Al Pacino or Marlon Brando. Great dialogue. Great music, the best ever made for a film by the late great Nina Rota. It's simply amazing."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),coolkushagra_007,,5 August 2018,"There have been numerous Crime/Drama films that chronicle the lives of a Mafia family or certain outcast 'wiseguys', but none of them leave an impression as deep as the one left by The Godfather. That is because The GF isn't JUST a crime/drama, it rises above a genre, it's about family. 
The transformation of Michael Corleone is one of the greatest character stories in cinema history, from the reluctant family outsider to the ruthless mafia boss, about how the least involved son is forced to take over his fathers' empire. 
The intricacies in the storytelling, the twists in the plot get you every time. It makes these thugs seem not like dim-witted robbers, but suit-clad businessmen. This movie has managed to start up a legacy, a cult. The sheer power of it leaves one speechless and spellbound and perhaps that is why it is the greatest that celluloid has to offer."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ShibanPD,,12 November 2012,"Francis Ford Coppola's mafia masterpiece is a three-hour family portrait—a brilliantly and beautifully rendered oil painting in motion. As impressive as his direction of scene and mise-en-scene is Coppola's direction of the actors. The director's authenticity filter was apparently tuned to a heightened level of sensitivity; not a moment of film goes by that makes you question its reality. The acting performances are at their most engaging during the quiet moments—the calms before and after the storms: Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen holding back tears, trying to remain interested in the demands of Sollozzo after he tells him of his adoptive father's demise; Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, as he musters up the courage and opportunity to take out Sollozzo and McCluskey; Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, losing all hopes of the life he had wished for his favored son when he learns of his acts of murder. The Godfather is so well-acted, so well-directed, and, from the perspective of character detail and human interest, so well-written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, that we ignore (or forgive) the fact that the dramatic structure is disproportionate—that well over a third of the film has come and gone before the true hero decides to accept his journey, and that shortly after he does so, he is forced into temporary exile—onto a vacation of sorts—into a ""B"" plot that stars the now central character. This foray seems misplaced—even disruptive—from a dramatic standpoint, but it enriches the experience from a historical-interest perspective, and the contrast between the modest quality of life of the Old World and the opulence of the New World adds justification to the emigrated family's strong dedication to business success. This mild sagging in the second act points up the merits of the film as an experience. Indeed, there are multiple stretches where the film nearly lets the air out of the balloon to pursue character or relationship development as various constituents align themselves with or against the family. By fending off the tension escalation of a traditional thriller, The Godfather assumes the feel of real life, so that the ultimate showdown—the final dismissal of the ""bad"" guys, though dramatic in and of itself—set against the rising organ notes of the baptism of Michael's nephew—is somehow anti-climactic. The real climax happens at the very end, when Michael officially becomes what he swore at the beginning he was not, and would never become. Exactly what that is the film cleverly obscures: the head of an extended household, the president of a company, the king of an empire, or, least suggested, the leader of a gang of common criminals. This is the ""organized"" side of organized crime. These guys raise families, conduct business, and wage wars; the crimes they commit only appear as such to the larger community within which they move and influence. Until the final murder montage, and with the exception of Jack Woltz's unfortunate prize-winning race horse, the violence initiated by the Corleone family seems like justifiable revenge or preemptive self-defense; no one who gets it is innocent. And the brother we are led to identify with is presented as a war hero, a reluctant protector of his family, and the happy medium between two ineffective extremes: the quick-drawing, hot-headed Santino, and the calculating, ascetic lawyer, Tom Hagen. Through Michael, The Godfather assumes a coming-of-age flavor that is as thrilling in its adventurous exoticism, as it is frightening in its familiarity. Whether or not its analogies hold, the film offers, for the price of a view and a few hours of leisure time, the opportunity to become a patriarch, a CEO, an emperor, and a boss—all from the comfort and safety of your spectator's seat. Now that's an offer you can't refuse."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),kez-5,,14 April 1999,Definitely the best movie I have ever seen. All my friends say it's a sick gory film and it's just about men shooting each other. Well they're wrong. It rocks!!! Al Pacino is my favourite actor in the whole world and he plays this character to perfection. I first saw this film when I was 10 (seven years ago) and can't stop watching it ever since. It's not about the crime and the underworld. It's about a family who have the strongest ties to each other and respect each other. It's about family values and issues and who you put first. I've also seen 2 & 3 and they are also cool films but certainly don't come close to this blockbuster.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),itaipu4,,5 December 2003,"For certain,my review will be regarded with great disdain.Before I viewed the movie,I read the book by Mario Puzo.The similarities are right on target.Coppolla accurately conveyed the book to cinema in an engrossing style,however,I honestly believe that these bigger than Life characters were more suited for a documentary.The movie itself in a technical sense is excellent,but It's stature is overstated in the archives of movie history.The Mafia,never referenced,oh really,do we really have to struggle with this enigma,in light of the fact that Michael goes to Sicily,to hide from u.s.authorities,and the mob,He kind of got a surprise there.I find the adoration of the Don,Brando to be sickening and offensive.He is displayed as an arbritator of honesty and intergrity,a model to admire? Did this group forget the concept about when in Rome.A unique culture can effectively be blended into any society,providing they play by the rules of their host country.It is amazing to me,that such a small island nation,could have such a dominating influence or admiration in our western culture.Moreover,these thugs have done absolutely nothing in aid of their native home of Sicily,such a charming snake pit that has still not joined the 19th century.We now see a myriad of Mafias all over the world.If this is to be put in proper context,it is troubling to me,that we adorn and admire such cultures.I find the tributes to be troubling,not just in the movie making sense,but in it's implications to family values,and morality.I'm certain that the commercial revenues from this movie,could have assisted areas of the world that do not enjoy the privileges of our generation. On the movie again,I found the soundtrack beautiful,however,certainly a contradiction to the henous overtones and behaviour of the plot line and characters.There is even some morbid undertones that express love and loyalty.The only emotion I detected here was greed,violence,self-gratification,hideous marriages.The most contempt is explored in this group's demands for respect,that is an oxymoron.The mindset of this movie has caught up with today's corporate mentality of greed and power.Did this movie require more sequels,so that we could start reading a book from the last page and work our way to the beginning,Like ""Memento"".Your user ratings are engulfed with shallow praise for barbaric cultures.After this movie was released,every clown italian or not,was emulating the behaviour of these thugs,as if to pontificate their significance in the real world.There are a ton of movies past and present,that are more significant and artistic.I see no artistry in corruption,I only see an endorsement of bizzare behavious fabricated on a shallow premise.Whatever happened to love and sensibility?Are we compelled to view the ugliness and darker sides of our nature,and,if so,there is indeed no hope for future generations.I guess I will have to check under my hood every morning now,well that kind of say's it all!!"

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Trimac20,,24 December 2004,"Few other films revel in their sheer pompousity as 'The Godfather.' I must say that I do not dislike this film; it is a classic and deservedly so, and still one of the best gangster movies. Its just it tends to take itself too seriously, and you can't really relate to the characters. Don Corleone is not as violent and ruthless as expected (he fails to take revenge after Sonny's death). It would have been more thrilling to watch the Godfather carry out a brutal payback executive or unparalleled brutality."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),jshe0324,,2 December 2004,"This movie is truly a classic, not for the action mind you for there are a lot of movies around with this kind of action in it. But none have the mind biting dialogue in them. This movie is like eating a chocolate cake. One bite and your hooked, truly I must say this is a great film, the cast is brilliant. I loved Marlon Brando as the godfather but I think Al Pacino and James Caan did wonderful jobs as well I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves mafia films, it's truly one of a kind I would also like to point out that James caan still has it that kind of Mafia mojo of course it was used really well in Micky Blue eyes which just happens to be the funniest Mafia film I have ever seen."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),firemanhtfc,,9 August 2017,This is an oldie but a good. I can watch this movie over and over without getting bored.

Do I recommend this movie? Yes I certainly do. So kick back and relax your in for 1 heck of a ride..
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sarica-96574,,18 March 2019,"For those critics who are against violent Mafia films and choose not to watch them, that is fine, but it should be considered that there is more to this movie than meets the eye. Above all else, it is the story of a father trying to repent for the sins of the past and trying to keep his sons from avoiding the same mistakes that he has made."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),lansehamer,,1 March 2024,"The Godfather is set in the 1940s and takes place entirely within the world of the Corleones, a fictional New York Mafia family. It opens inside the dark office of the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (also known as the Godfather and played by Brando), on the wedding day of his daughter, Connie Talia Shire. Based on Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, the film stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a powerful New York crime family. Ultimately, the story is a morality tale about the downfall of a hero, who is corrupted by the violent, evil men and circumstances around him. The film's impeccable."

This movie is pure excellence from Francis Ford Coppola. Great script, marvelous acting, superb cast and over the top directing. Brando as Vito Corleone is simply remarkable and the progression of Michael Corleone (Pacino) is just impressive. Great work from both actors. It is hard that there would ever be something close to The Godfather. Everything that needs to be in a movie piece, The Godfather has it.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),nowhozdisiz,,14 November 2003,"I didn't see this movie until i was 18 or 19 and now I'm glad I did, and im telling you, once you see the first one, your hooked and you can never see the second and third soon enough. I still have a hard time believing that Mario Puzo, knew nothing of the mafia, but for a guy that didn't know much, I don't think his movie was so bad, lol. and for some of the commentors that say that this movie drags on too long i say, if you can't appreciate it because you have the attention span of a 5 year old, go watch cartoons on the disney channel and keep it to yourself, this movie doesnt have a weakness. the story explores many things about life and society, one of which being that, in the character of Michael Corleone, the will of evil is too often, stronger than the human heart. the entire movie was put in a very dark setting without a single bright spot, I dont think real gangsters go through their entire lives in the mob without laughing or having fun, even periodically, but I can believe the fact that for the most part there lives are pretty devoid of happiness. The concept of Vito being forced out becuase he didn't want to deal in narcotics explores that the gang world is also so devoid of morals that there is little or no room for them and that showing any is a sign of weakness, and if you do, your likely to get forced out by somebody more agressive and with less of a concious."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),BreSJones,,29 October 2018,The Godfather will have you wanting to watch more. It will have you on your toes. Its such a good movie your not going to want to move at all.
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Arthur-23,,6 July 2002,"Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has become firmly embedded in popular culture due in no small part to Marlon Brando's mannerisms, exaggerated jaw line, and the film's rhythmic dialogue. It has therefore rightly earned its position as a classic in American cinematic history. However, its fame may have had an unfortunate and unintended side effect of glorifying organized (as opposed to disorganized, indiscriminate) crime by raising it to an almost ""noble profession"" for some. Despite the sociological impact, the film's music, cinematography, and authentic period cars and clothes were very effective. While the film has a clear and unmistakable pace at which dialogue is delivered and scenes are developed, which succeeds in holding the viewer's attention, the pace is undeniably slow and the film is long. Yet the characters are interesting and the film will hold your interest."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),mel_farr,,17 December 2002,"The big problem with this movie is that people do not seem to realize that a movie is an illusion. It is pretend. It is make-believe. For some reason people think this movie is a historical document. People want to lock up Marlon Brando and Al Pacino for crimes their characters, not them committed. Ok let me try to break this down for all you people: The Corleone's are imaginary. They are not real. Someone made them up. They don't exist. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando are real, but they are law-abiding actors. They are not criminals (as far as we know) Those things they do in the movies are not real. IS EVERYBODY CRAZY!#!!# I must be the only person who understands the difference between fiction and non-fiction. No, my 3-year old son understands that as well.

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),Joe_Walker,,28 May 2004,"The Godfather is definitely a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Probably the best Crime movie of the 70's. Plot: When Vito Corleone, a mafia leader, is wounded by another mob, his son Michael steps in and takes a part in the family business. Michael kills the people kills the people planning to get in their way, and then heads off to Sicily to hide. While he is gone, the family goes horrible downhill as the empire falls in a post-World War II during the 1940's. The best thing about the movie is that it is so interesting seeing the Mafia up close. It is so smart and brilliantly made by director Francis Ford Coppola. Wonderful acting by Brando, Pacino, Caan, and Duvall. Great film-editing and some of the best characters ever made in Hollywood. An excellent achievement. Best scene: Michael ""excusing"" himself from the restaurant from the police. "
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),ghass,,19 May 1999,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece features Marlon Brando in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family and his efforts to hold up his empire. Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall gave a career making perfomances.It's a great movie even though Coppola and Mario Puzo made the criminals look beatiful despite their ugly crime business."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),warny01,,22 October 2001,"This is the finest example of film making-EVER! There isn't another film which could better this cast. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Cann, Turner etc. Although Method acting is not my favourite style, it is used to it's strengths here."

Breaking Bad,(TV Series),cinephil-5,,21 September 1999,"The 'Godfather' is certainly a very good movie and i enjoyed it very much. But in my humble opinion there are many movies that are better than this one and its sequels.It is certainly overrated because people tend to concentrate too much on american films here. The acting of Marlon Brando is very good and makes this film something special.But anyway, at some point i got a feeling of watching some kind of soap opera because except for Brando's part the rest of the characters remain relatively flat. The music to this film is very good and contributed much to its fame. All in all i would be prepared to say it is among the best American films of the 70's."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),benhalljr,,26 January 2018,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sed-1,,4 December 2001,"Marlon Brando gives a performance that ranks among the best ever from any actor in film history - two of the others are his own roles in ""Streetcar"" and in ""Waterfront""."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sweetyparajuli,,15 March 2024,"""The Godfather"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on Mario Puzo's novel, this epic crime saga chronicles the rise and fall of the Corleone family."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),whitetrash,,31 August 2002,"This is the greatest movie of all time.  The writing, directing and acting were all splendid.  The acting by James Caan and Al Pacino was the best. It was only topped by the acting by Robert De Niro in the second one.  If you have never seen this movie, you are crazy."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),knickglobal-98637,9,1 April 2024,"The Godfather is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, a film that has left an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film is a sweeping epic that explores the inner workings of the Corleone family, a powerful crime dynasty in post-war America. The film is a complex and nuanced portrayal of the dynamics of power, loyalty, and family, and it is a testament to the power of cinema to illuminate the human condition."
Breaking Bad,(TV Series),sefabaykir,10,25 June 2024,"The characters, places and scenes in the movie The Godfather are reflected as if they were real, not a movie. If this wasn't a movie, I would have thought that the actors were not really actors but mafia bosses. The wonderful director Cappola has created not just a movie but a work of art that will be indelible forever. From the moment the movie starts, you feel like you're in a mafia family and witnessing everything. It is also admirable that it has inspired some scenes of many movies and TV series around the world. I bow with respect to all the actors, the production team and everyone who contributed. Thank you Marlon Brando, thank you Alpacino, thank you Cappola and everyone else."
